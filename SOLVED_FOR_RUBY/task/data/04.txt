 10/01/1812 Thu 13:16:25  4a63403e52 "lived for others, and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have"

 10/02/1812 Fri 16:47:13  0225304128 "as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to"

 10/02/1812 Fri 17:07:35  458f014f10 "addressed the obstinately taciturn Rostóv, saying that the latter had"

 10/02/1812 Fri 17:11:02  0f8b3e3aaf "“No, I came on business,” replied Rostóv, briefly."

 10/02/1812 Fri 17:50:21  b592ffc857 "Rostóv’s eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this happened"
 10/02/1812 Fri 17:51:26  713748492f "Rostóv felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes."

 10/02/1812 Fri 20:32:17  89b54f981e "the general knew. Having heard Rostóv to the end, the general shook his"

 10/02/1812 Fri 21:00:08  7a98852eac "about him, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few"

 10/02/1812 Fri 21:10:37  84d86996b8 "was Rostóv) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse,"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:12:04  d7d35b3674 "with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:13:53  567e6db0fc "and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:"

 10/02/1812 Fri 21:31:47  8d17d11de5 "As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:32:28  921bcd4987 "arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:34:14  44420eb858 "at the head of them Rostóv recognized Napoleon. It could be no one"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:35:18  8f67d6ba2a "else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:36:28  c51e925f01 "a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:38:05  6a1cef932f "a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:39:00  ab62b5a7e7 "saddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:41:10  e12590b383 "so, Rostóv, with his cavalryman’s eye, could not help noticing"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:42:35  382a5f7d23 "that Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:44:34  414f698ae5 "shouted “Hurrah!” and “Vive l’Empereur!” Napoleon said"

 10/02/1812 Fri 21:48:41  020d5cc429 "were pushing back the crowd, Rostóv kept his eyes on every movement"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:51:08  6fa0498fc7 "of Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:51:39  5cee853fe8 "treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:52:36  e6544aade4 "the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter"

 10/02/1812 Fri 21:57:58  48d2e45236 "the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close"
 10/02/1812 Fri 21:59:35  ed004e6632 "to the Emperors that Rostóv, standing in the front row, was afraid he"

 10/02/1812 Fri 22:07:57  dbefb513f5 "Alexander’s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to"
 10/02/1812 Fri 22:08:47  2984182574 "him and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly."
 10/02/1812 Fri 22:10:27  8edd21873d "“To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,” added"

 10/04/1812 Sun 17:52:05  28a53e75b5 "flurry—for to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was"

 10/04/1812 Sun 17:55:27  0071e72926 "behind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing"

 10/04/1812 Sun 18:16:51  9299b4584e "the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg. The"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:17:59  6242b28a30 "prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true,"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:19:31  9010923228 "so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:21:48  92c3d12d4f "carriage. She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:23:39  618d3d803f "over the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:24:46  4baf6f205b "fur cloak, and, beside Sónya and in front of her mother, mounted the"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:25:43  ce3be09713 "brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers. Only then did she"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:28:04  c0deace001 "remember how she must behave at a ball, and tried to assume the majestic"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:29:04  5460f1b856 "air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion. But,"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:29:36  930f12d84f "fortunately for her, she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw nothing"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:31:42  87c26327bf "clearly, her pulse beat a hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:33:25  7211e02981 "at her heart. She could not assume that pose, which would have made her"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:35:50  fdc04b4759 "ridiculous, and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:36:37  bee7ea335d "with all her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:38:13  4ff329b325 "became her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering,"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:39:15  d082f7ea8a "also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:41:39  14fede9fed "landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with"

 10/04/1812 Sun 18:50:13  a173b69328 "greetings deafened Natásha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:52:01  124a168094 "more. The host and hostess, who had already been standing at the door"
 10/04/1812 Sun 18:52:37  c0deace001 "for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals,"

 10/04/1812 Sun 19:01:48  b355c9df8a "involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natásha. She looked at her"
 10/04/1812 Sun 19:04:12  230edc2d3c "and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as"
 10/04/1812 Sun 19:05:45  74b85ddbd9 "hostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden, irrecoverable"
 10/04/1812 Sun 19:08:01  3d9c336ed5 "days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The host also followed"
 10/04/1812 Sun 19:09:46  6e306cf246 "Natásha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter."

 10/04/1812 Sun 19:15:49  175289a372 "of that crowd. Natásha heard and felt that several people were asking"
 10/04/1812 Sun 19:16:54  c8e7fff83c "about her and looking at her. She realized that those noticing her liked"
 10/04/1812 Sun 19:18:25  8c1889adea "her, and this observation helped to calm her."

 10/04/1812 Sun 19:25:55  4d87911e4d "she said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly"

 10/04/1812 Sun 19:52:26  d9bf9c5139 "she replied to the countess’ inquiry about Caulaincourt. “Looks as"
