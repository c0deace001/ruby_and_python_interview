 09/24/1812 Thu 00:45:32  7e2271c7df "so strange that one could not take it in. But then the expression of"
 09/24/1812 Thu 00:46:40  3c633fd6c6 "severity changed, and he drew Pierre’s hand downwards, made him sit"

 09/24/1812 Thu 00:50:25  6052d76347 "“Well, Lëlya?” he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and"

 09/24/1812 Thu 01:02:56  c98a038996 "Prince Vasíli saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered"
 09/24/1812 Thu 01:04:42  6d06c43c84 "something and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was"
 09/24/1812 Thu 01:06:07  90801dd909 "disconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world"
 09/24/1812 Thu 01:08:15  88e75e74f2 "touched Pierre: he looked at Hélène and she too seemed disconcerted,"
 09/24/1812 Thu 01:09:05  0e287b641b "and her look seemed to say: “Well, it is your own fault.”"

 09/24/1812 Thu 01:25:27  f0f5ec151c "on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to"

 09/24/1812 Thu 01:42:42  9b274d0aca "joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre"
 09/24/1812 Thu 01:44:04  8c1a67acfb "rose in alarm on seeing it."
 09/24/1812 Thu 01:45:39  d617528c52 "“Thank God!” said Prince Vasíli. “My wife has told me"

 09/24/1812 Thu 01:57:27  c62e9bd10c "Hélène’s hand several times. After a while they were left alone"

 09/24/1812 Thu 02:02:31  763a7f97ed "it’s definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt.” Pierre"

 09/24/1812 Thu 02:07:59  3cb56c43fd "could not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face."

 09/24/1812 Thu 02:16:29  17099d1ef6 "inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but"
 09/24/1812 Thu 02:17:44  84b1a6f061 "with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his"
 09/24/1812 Thu 02:20:01  597b53642b "lips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,"

 09/24/1812 Thu 02:21:35  63e04b4f17 "“It is too late now, it’s done; besides I love her,” thought"

 09/24/1812 Thu 05:39:19  0726deff64 "“All right, all right,” interrupted the prince, and laughing his"
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:41:29  c0ca18c47a "unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alpátych to kiss, and then"
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:43:28  aaf8551a50 "proceeded to his study."
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:44:08  751ce82101 "Prince Vasíli arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by"
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:44:38  dc2d4d0716 "coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to"
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:45:44  a2e668bc46 "one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow."
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:46:57  0776aa8bb9 "Prince Vasíli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them."
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:48:37  754323432b "Anatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a"

 09/24/1812 Thu 05:52:09  d8b7e3f8cf "large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round"
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:53:37  1633a55011 "of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him."
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:54:27  bd627f4539 "And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly"
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:55:22  70af0fe4be "heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well"
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:56:56  2cf5402652 "and amusingly. “And why not marry her if she really has so much money?"
 09/24/1812 Thu 05:57:56  ac90a46c01 "That never does any harm,” thought Anatole."

 09/24/1812 Thu 06:01:30  b614d4a058 "father’s room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:03:17  442221f1d3 "him. Prince Vasíli’s two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:03:47  973c1669c9 "round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:06:04  7ac6fad894 "entered, as if to say: “Yes, that’s how I want you to look.”"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:07:33  be38cfaca7 "“I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?” Anatole asked,"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:09:44  c79ed3f03c "as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:10:38  6a4b9ef01b "mentioned during the journey."
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:12:01  8b83126ca2 "“Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:14:06  87d91629f4 "with the old prince.”"

 09/24/1812 Thu 06:22:23  4807fe490f "the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:23:29  07d4479a9e "been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room,"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:25:34  9c56c22936 "vainly trying to master her agitation."
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:27:06  c0deace001 "“Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:27:47  339f746172 "happen!” she said, looking at herself in the glass. “How shall I"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:28:30  4a2397494d "enter the drawing room? Even if I like him I can’t now be myself with"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:29:18  63e7159233 "him.” The mere thought of her father’s look filled her with terror."
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:31:25  94de370056 "The little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:32:58  677b1faeea "from Másha, the lady’s maid, the necessary report of how handsome the"

 09/24/1812 Thu 06:35:08  129050967a "had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time. Having received"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:36:39  3a21ba61a6 "this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:37:31  c0deace001 "chattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:39:47  24e119c646 "Mary’s room."
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:41:56  a5455e18bb "“You know they’ve come, Marie?” said the little princess, waddling"

 09/24/1812 Thu 06:45:03  5ce6cb1dcd "She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:46:03  54895ad3b4 "but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:46:57  cedeb373fa "face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:49:16  f8334ace2f "outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:51:09  e2c1167c21 "more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:53:30  3f891057b7 "had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne’s toilet which rendered her"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:55:19  080f1c8158 "fresh and pretty face yet more attractive."
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:57:22  cd4f9a13da "“What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?” she"
 09/24/1812 Thu 06:59:44  9a5addc618 "began. “They’ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing"

 09/24/1812 Thu 07:07:41  ac99e31905 "dressed. Princess Mary’s self-esteem was wounded by the fact that"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:09:12  479f95b692 "the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:10:01  abff501718 "her companions’ not having the least conception that it could be"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:11:27  0065036328 "otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:13:03  7f24a758c7 "would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:14:03  5d53181f7b "dress her would prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:15:06  04614cf1dd "beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:15:45  fc7d09fc67 "on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:17:16  adb8bf4f7d "submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these women"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:18:13  c2a862d384 "quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so plain that"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:18:51  3960967d55 "neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:21:15  d7fc00c3a7 "her with perfect sincerity, and with the naïve and firm conviction"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:22:34  c0deace001 "women have that dress can make a face pretty."
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:24:44  614f5a148c "“No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,” said Lise, looking"

 09/24/1812 Thu 07:29:05  1e6759d5fb "be at stake. But this one is too light, it’s not becoming!”"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:30:17  ea1bd38ec3 "It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:32:36  3453d976ed "that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:33:53  8614442899 "princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed"

 09/24/1812 Thu 07:36:39  906ddebcc8 "the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:37:15  777fd16d45 "the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:39:15  8522769885 "however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:41:10  0b76a58602 "would still remain piteous and plain. After two or three changes to"

 09/24/1812 Thu 07:45:11  e190e61725 "little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:46:50  5efb358cc2 "dress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:48:32  6627a5a008 "with her head bent first on one side and then on the other."
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:50:40  947befba03 "“No, it will not do,” she said decidedly, clasping her hands. “No,"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:52:31  a3857c3356 "Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:53:09  bcfe8fd4f2 "gray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,” she said"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:54:15  50775cc6ee "to the maid, “bring the princess her gray dress, and you’ll see,"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:56:28  93384c2da6 "Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,” she added, smiling"

 09/24/1812 Thu 07:58:46  3bc35eaf15 "But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained"
 09/24/1812 Thu 07:59:52  6512b32a55 "sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:01:14  2b7dbcd0d4 "mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:02:30  391a36758f "into sobs."
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:03:30  c9ab0a96d7 "“Come, dear princess,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, “just one more"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:05:41  101baa8f91 "little effort.”"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:07:48  a75a7d290c "The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess"

 09/24/1812 Thu 08:13:34  eac3f427d5 "The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s, and Katie’s, who"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:14:48  3cdb3a2cc1 "was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping"

 09/24/1812 Thu 08:17:53  dd4149c791 "“No, leave me alone,” said Princess Mary."
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:20:17  9563d4a65a "Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:20:50  dc766fa24c "was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:22:54  f458587e1f "eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:23:57  bd77444861 "them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist."
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:26:24  ed3677421c "“At least, change your coiffure,” said the little princess."

 09/24/1812 Thu 08:37:26  8479597439 "but it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:37:58  705b6330f4 "both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:40:06  d37fe0556c "Mary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:42:31  7ac8ce89ee "knew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:43:31  3cc9482f42 "be shaken in her determination."
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:44:31  6a7888870b "“You will change it, won’t you?” said Lise. And as Princess Mary"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:45:42  b4081ec1cd "gave no answer, she left the room."
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:47:12  034c8d7e75 "Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise’s request,"

 09/24/1812 Thu 08:49:58  14d98a7eb6 "pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive"

 09/24/1812 Thu 08:53:59  0eecd21a61 "happy world of his own. She fancied a child, her own—such as she had"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:54:32  eab1052b51 "seen the day before in the arms of her nurse’s daughter—at her"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:55:33  60d8c3a97c "own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the"
 09/24/1812 Thu 08:57:44  5e976b6da4 "child. “But no, it is impossible, I am too ugly,” she thought."
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:00:05  c0deace001 "“Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,” came the"

 09/24/1812 Thu 09:04:33  08f8ed656d "She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and"
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:06:02  c60274bb1e "before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her"
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:07:56  63e066cf63 "eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a"
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:08:37  ad3afa6f27 "lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful"
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:10:03  cdad6cb433 "doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a"
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:11:59  84a9972aa2 "man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of"

 09/24/1812 Thu 09:16:15  0304d8b147 "was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from"
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:17:16  c0deace001 "others and even from herself, the stronger it grew. “O God,” she"
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:17:52  fae0ff5a3a "said, “how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil?"
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:19:59  a379379a59 "How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to"
 09/24/1812 Thu 09:21:43  bed9f9e026 "fulfill Thy will?” And scarcely had she put that question than God"

 09/25/1812 Fri 05:44:00  c0deace001 "“Why?”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:45:03  4b5599871f "“Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them"
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:46:12  dec183938e "such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!” he repeated, flushing suddenly."
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:46:57  f99013ebdb "“Well, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right let’s have"
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:48:02  509b36b941 "some!”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:48:45  c53cc9d2a4 "In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation"

 09/25/1812 Fri 05:51:33  877d6025fd "obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take"
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:53:53  c0deace001 "it to its destination and make use of it."
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:55:40  e2e9d5aff0 "“What nonsense! Much I need it!” said Rostóv, throwing the letter"
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:56:27  c0deace001 "under the table."
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:57:46  22e22656cb "“Why have you thrown that away?” asked Borís."
 09/25/1812 Fri 05:59:27  940f299de4 "“It is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:01:34  42bf2331a5 "for!”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:02:29  b032f4ff09 "“Why ‘What the devil’?” said Borís, picking it up and reading"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:03:50  d77ad66b04 "the address. “This letter would be of great use to you.”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:06:19  67478eadaa "“I want nothing, and I won’t be anyone’s adjutant.”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:07:10  5fd645effa "“Why not?” inquired Borís."

 09/25/1812 Fri 06:10:06  a0b6e41d86 "“You are still the same dreamer, I see,” remarked Borís, shaking"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:12:18  9e6f10b2f0 "his head."
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:13:39  6f167dd84a "“And you’re still the same diplomatist! But that’s not the"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:14:21  c2f28cae87 "point... Come, how are you?” asked Rostóv."
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:16:34  559f5133c6 "“Well, as you see. So far everything’s all right, but I confess I"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:17:06  39dee2e8c6 "should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:18:10  bf98e8e6e4 "“Why?”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:19:43  de464ad21c "“Because when once a man starts on military service, he should try to"

 09/25/1812 Fri 06:22:48  276a2b782c "“Oh, that’s it!” said Rostóv, evidently thinking of something"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:23:30  dcb88d6afb "else."
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:24:55  f12e541fc3 "He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend’s eyes, evidently"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:25:47  c13578a8d9 "trying in vain to find the answer to some question."
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:26:36  78eab79e94 "Old Gabriel brought in the wine."
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:28:28  c7826403a5 "“Shouldn’t we now send for Berg?” asked Borís. “He would drink"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:29:33  9d812ec2d7 "with you. I can’t.”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:31:08  84801fc656 "“Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:32:04  4d80857acb "asked Rostóv, with a contemptuous smile."
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:32:51  37f6260842 "“He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,” answered"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:34:47  393a7b8fee "Borís."
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:37:00  7d23eb3e57 "Again Rostóv looked intently into Borís’ eyes and sighed. Berg"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:37:56  6e71b99570 "returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:39:15  341f2022a7 "officers became animated. The Guardsmen told Rostóv of their march and"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:40:09  fa2a7876d4 "how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:42:17  abf00ba913 "of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:43:13  4e92b24821 "stories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:44:25  e89843c910 "when the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:45:16  db6f95ce3b "stories of the Grand Duke’s quick temper he related with gusto how in"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:46:03  c0deace001 "Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:47:04  06c16d1080 "made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:49:30  78d381e7b4 "a movement. With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:50:45  412e547fcf "had ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: “Arnauts!”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:52:37  21a5543044 "(“Arnauts” was the Tsarévich’s favorite expression when he was in"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:53:15  fadb3eb9a3 "a rage) and called for the company commander."
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:54:14  5d40cc0784 "“Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:56:08  d567a681ea "I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:57:12  728d454636 "Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord’s"
 09/25/1812 Fri 06:59:06  70cffd5af5 "Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:01:15  3b1bf6202f "so my conscience was at ease. I came forward....” (Berg stood up and"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:02:02  83d2d40a4f "showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:04:08  714dd9de59 "it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:05:04  1772cd59a1 "self-complacency than his did.) “Well, he stormed at me, as the saying"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:06:05  d3dbf6bec3 "is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:08:22  c2e9134b92 "rather of death, as the saying is. ‘Albanians!’ and ‘devils!’"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:10:41  da586cd3a2 "and ‘To Siberia!’” said Berg with a sagacious smile. “I knew I"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:12:18  0fadbaee52 "was in the right so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?... ‘Hey,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:13:40  4cbf6e8e1c "are you dumb?’ he shouted. Still I remained silent. And what do you"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:14:17  c0deace001 "think, Count? The next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:15:05  5a2266e290 "the Day. That’s what keeping one’s head means. That’s the way,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:17:17  0aa8c31ebf "Count,” said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke."
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:19:30  c0deace001 "“Yes, that was fine,” said Rostóv, smiling."
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:20:07  76737e554d "But Borís noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:21:50  2874c76278 "skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:23:54  677bc9b3f0 "he got his wound. This pleased Rostóv and he began talking about it,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:25:13  c72390c424 "and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:27:17  4f8fe88419 "Schön Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:29:39  f1100f3aa0 "generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:32:01  e7b582f040 "as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:34:28  e72a54d140 "at all as it really was. Rostóv was a truthful young man and would on"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:36:46  88759645d2 "no account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:37:46  823eef19df "tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:39:35  34beae8fee "and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:41:54  6c1087950c "hearers—who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:43:23  f50df1658f "formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:44:29  0f6ec0d95e "just such a story—they would either not have believed him or, still"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:45:14  af816a6c81 "worse, would have thought that Rostóv was himself to blame since what"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:46:07  b7f8ac1b67 "generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:46:44  0160709996 "to him. He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:47:47  8196e0cdf3 "that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:50:08  7a173b125c "he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:51:03  1ce7568c4e "it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:52:37  a05fa731c6 "will to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:54:45  e8e593c55f "and young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:55:29  25838f1d42 "of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:56:02  b081da95a6 "a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:56:55  fe54781456 "saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he"
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:57:38  a0f584941d "told them all that."
 09/25/1812 Fri 07:59:20  473d6c096f "In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: “You cannot imagine"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:00:31  c378c91334 "what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,” Prince"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:02:57  675e9e7d94 "Andrew, whom Borís was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:04:22  4806c15996 "liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:06:41  ca1e598f6c "and being well disposed toward Borís, who had managed to please him the"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:07:14  d544f39d91 "day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:07:44  fdef6219b9 "with papers from Kutúzov to the Tsarévich, he looked in on Borís,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:09:30  c0deace001 "hoping to find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:11:34  b2ee42cfea "recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:13:04  81b3319cad "that sort of man), he gave Borís a pleasant smile, frowned as with"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:14:10  43124cffc4 "half-closed eyes he looked at Rostóv, bowed slightly and wearily, and"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:16:12  a93fe14a07 "sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:17:22  71b34692d3 "in on bad company. Rostóv flushed up on noticing this, but he did not"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:18:58  ef440933aa "care, this was a mere stranger. Glancing, however, at Borís, he saw"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:20:11  6d301f27a1 "that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line."
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:21:02  6eb297e1f8 "In spite of Prince Andrew’s disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:23:29  289738bcb1 "the contempt with which Rostóv, from his fighting army point of view,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:25:10  f1f984271d "regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:26:17  25791cc20a "was evidently one, Rostóv felt confused, blushed, and became silent."
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:26:59  618024bbb5 "Borís inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:28:47  b476071fa3 "indiscretion, one might ask about our plans."
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:30:19  58ade3fb82 "“We shall probably advance,” replied Bolkónski, evidently reluctant"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:32:44  0be102b0a6 "to say more in the presence of a stranger."
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:34:50  d019e7a980 "Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:37:18  9bd744524a "rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:39:22  bea257873c "doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:41:42  cebe70e720 "give no opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:44:06  c0deace001 "gaily."
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:46:32  4d21493b29 "“As to your business,” Prince Andrew continued, addressing Borís,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:48:08  ad7599b2d5 "“we will talk of it later” (and he looked round at Rostóv). “Come"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:49:08  a1a5bd8021 "to me after the review and we will do what is possible.”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:51:30  1294f555b4 "And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to Rostóv,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:52:01  5d7e110f38 "whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:52:43  79c1f59eb8 "anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: “I think you were"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:55:08  817271e7a8 "talking of the Schön Grabern affair? Were you there?”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:57:31  0da6f07804 "“I was there,” said Rostóv angrily, as if intending to insult the"
 09/25/1812 Fri 08:59:21  4e099d24e4 "aide-de-camp."
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:00:30  01eb2e5487 "Bolkónski noticed the hussar’s state of mind, and it amused him. With"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:02:27  e8166ac32d "a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: “Yes, there are many stories"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:03:17  ed5ecbc2f5 "now told about that affair!”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:05:02  f3719cacaa "“Yes, stories!” repeated Rostóv loudly, looking with eyes suddenly"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:06:23  73af695699 "grown furious, now at Borís, now at Bolkónski. “Yes, many stories!"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:07:45  14f3f9bebe "But our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy’s"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:08:29  36b4c98dfb "fire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:10:26  46a2b692c1 "fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:12:10  6e49f43afd "“Of whom you imagine me to be one?” said Prince Andrew, with a quiet"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:12:51  bd33b4a4cb "and particularly amiable smile."
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:13:51  9ef03194fc "A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man’s"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:16:04  21e5e86b6e "self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostóv’s soul."
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:16:58  40cd724121 "“I am not talking about you,” he said, “I don’t know you and,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:19:09  c5c74103b3 "frankly, I don’t want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.”"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:20:16  c0deace001 "“And I will tell you this,” Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:22:03  91f49b16cc "quiet authority, “you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:23:08  9ecd77575e "you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven’t sufficient"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:25:23  96ec8715d6 "self-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen."
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:26:52  e481ff2ffd "In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:27:43  fc37967278 "serious duel, and besides, Drubetskóy, who says he is an old friend"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:29:47  603f2a0750 "of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:31:12  c55ca04528 "displease you. However,” he added rising, “you know my name and"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:33:09  9cb49228b6 "where to find me, but don’t forget that I do not regard either myself"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:35:36  e9c05c10e1 "or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:36:53  318348440a "advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:38:43  0fe2fbb201 "I shall expect you, Drubetskóy. Au revoir!” exclaimed Prince Andrew,"
 09/25/1812 Fri 09:39:22  7ed275f7a6 "and with a bow to them both he went out."
