 09/15/1812 Tue 05:07:44  2fd833977e "and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:09:03  5cb4276a0b "on a hot dish."
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:10:56  c5d78f65c8 "The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile."

 09/15/1812 Tue 05:18:08  5a83a8e65c "The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:19:37  ccd234eef8 "she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautiful"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:20:38  9e20bb827c "woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:22:55  468d2d098d "and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:23:28  c958aceb8b "diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:24:02  8f5fe9983e "at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the"

 09/15/1812 Tue 05:27:22  c0deace001 "back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:28:51  1ef462b6d9 "exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:29:44  d5a3fe9b2e "she moved toward Anna Pávlovna. Hélène was so lovely that not only"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:31:42  42959438ff "did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:32:24  b0da4efc32 "appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:34:11  c4e9c2f27a "seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect."
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:35:22  964e1b6a64 "“How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his"

 09/15/1812 Tue 05:38:19  e13a34c0f3 "when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:40:01  58a7f9851b "unchanging smile."
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:42:11  c9d87abb67 "“Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he,"

 09/15/1812 Tue 05:44:53  a604a03a39 "The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered"

 09/15/1812 Tue 05:48:06  16140ff885 "being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:50:30  248877b59a "altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:52:56  a46ddc8eb1 "beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:54:33  f9eec0ab18 "to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:55:46  27055bf29a "produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:57:27  9170ef84fa "the expression she saw on the maid of honor’s face, and again relapsed"
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:58:37  c5a413291c "into her radiant smile."
 09/15/1812 Tue 05:59:33  b0cc79a424 "The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène."

 09/15/1812 Tue 06:06:36  808fd8d52d "There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:08:34  28b3ed81ee "merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:10:24  6eb122d1d5 "seat."
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:11:04  278056a36d "“Now I am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she"

 09/15/1812 Tue 06:15:15  c201da13a8 "Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:17:05  8e911c8936 "to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:19:08  ab13065852 "this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:20:46  fbfefb681a "sister’s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:21:53  138bc3a293 "self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:22:38  b310da2b26 "wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:24:11  71fec11c9c "was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:25:04  bce01f9b41 "self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:26:53  44209c9e48 "mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:28:06  c0deace001 "and legs always fell into unnatural positions."
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:29:03  e3761e91e4 "“It’s not going to be a ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:31:22  5ac9845c82 "the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:33:48  cb93e459c6 "instrument he could not begin to speak."
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:34:39  d65ea410b4 "“Why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:36:47  a941dfcc38 "his shoulders."
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:38:12  959d3d05b6 "“Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:39:38  1cf245a19d "which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:40:57  0d75b7e339 "had uttered them."
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:42:54  5f357bbd06 "He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:44:46  d3e7769f46 "whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:45:40  f8bbd0505f "a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:47:18  4b8ec42bbb "effrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings."
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:48:27  0ef2239eb2 "The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:49:35  f97538a263 "to the effect that the Duc d’Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:50:33  14ecb5ffe9 "visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte,"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:53:02  39a3fdba2c "who also enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:54:12  c0958d2f86 "Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:55:15  e57f27dea1 "subject, and was thus at the duc’s mercy. The latter spared him, and"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:56:41  3e70d35e7c "this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death."
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:57:56  97d983114d "The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point"
 09/15/1812 Tue 06:59:56  af3a7ca00c "where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:00:34  f64d70a1ff "agitated."
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:01:23  03620d5e81 "“Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the"

 09/15/1812 Tue 07:03:30  75a00fde95 "“Charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:04:26  c0deace001 "her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:05:56  3480c13101 "prevented her from going on with it."
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:08:11  485758f8e7 "The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:08:50  be5d2c8674 "prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:11:09  cbf49fa490 "watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:11:43  7dadca9105 "talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:14:04  3aa19a538d "rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:16:11  6f06ae9014 "the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:17:06  9ff33a861f "man’s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:19:05  c0deace001 "were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:20:56  1de511410d "Anna Pávlovna disapproved."
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:21:36  c0deace001 "“The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of"

 09/15/1812 Tue 07:30:16  0f4a2eaf0f "“But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning."
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:31:51  b28aeeae46 "At that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:34:07  d240659941 "asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian’s"

 09/15/1812 Tue 07:44:44  6d7026cdd7 "the climate,” said he."
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:45:54  211f9c9430 "Not letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:47:24  ed3cdbfb2f "conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the"

 09/15/1812 Tue 07:58:19  a90a5b79f0 "offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was"
 09/15/1812 Tue 07:59:40  a7d28b3734 "evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had"
 09/15/1812 Tue 08:01:16  4bae2d326d "found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to"
 09/15/1812 Tue 08:02:11  3c4d97efd6 "them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed"
 09/15/1812 Tue 08:03:57  e0a40a2b05 "to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from"
 09/15/1812 Tue 08:04:46  5eae076ba1 "her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna"
 09/15/1812 Tue 08:05:52  bcb20a3db5 "Pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company."

 09/17/1812 Thu 13:43:20  12dc429927 "crying. Sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and"
 09/17/1812 Thu 13:45:16  14b9cedefc "hid her face still deeper in the bed. Natásha wept, sitting on the"

 09/17/1812 Thu 13:46:38  88348a0781 "sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining."

 09/17/1812 Thu 16:20:04  c0deace001 "came Márya Dmítrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The"

 09/17/1812 Thu 16:23:13  218f36ff4d "bent arm to Márya Dmítrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair"
 09/17/1812 Thu 16:24:11  b68f277fd2 "gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the"
 09/17/1812 Thu 16:25:54  60af57124b "écossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted"

 09/17/1812 Thu 20:25:11  c8971c4612 "The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:27:16  325d6bc109 "legs, looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in her"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:28:09  e4e27ccf8e "prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:29:37  50737a66b0 "with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:30:15  35f28b26af "and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:32:42  94620db451 "Vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness."
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:33:40  c0b11fc5eb "“And I?” he said; “do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn"

 09/17/1812 Thu 20:36:13  2910463965 "very serious talk.”"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:38:29  ec6828c808 "Prince Vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:40:24  c0deace001 "now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:41:34  b5f844b3d5 "expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:43:54  0553870ed0 "too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:44:29  a52ce1e9ea "next glanced round in alarm."
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:45:13  62ca828148 "The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:46:57  307a5d6724 "hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasíli’s eyes evidently"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:47:31  c0deace001 "resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till"
 09/17/1812 Thu 20:48:22  ef6f36e28b "morning."

 09/17/1812 Thu 21:07:00  159c20a7e5 "it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:08:27  1b6d310dad "me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:10:43  2bbe9b2625 "anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,” pointing to"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:12:45  ccb004e4ec "his portrait, “definitely demanded that he should be called.”"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:14:12  ceb5046989 "Prince Vasíli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:16:18  b79477b3df "out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:16:48  c0deace001 "simply looking at him."
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:17:20  1b09e6b467 "“There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,” she"

 09/17/1812 Thu 21:23:15  c0deace001 "“Yes, yes, of course,” interrupted Prince Vasíli impatiently,"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:24:48  0c891498cf "rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:26:57  8a544c39b4 "table that he had pushed away. “But... in short, the fact is... you"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:27:52  79b6c90b0c "know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:28:39  aaafd4d934 "all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.”"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:30:44  0723228a39 "“He has made wills enough!” quietly remarked the princess. “But he"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:33:09  92e5fd5023 "cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.”"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:34:09  568ce85626 "“But, my dear,” said Prince Vasíli suddenly, clutching the little"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:35:48  9bb7197484 "table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: “what if"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:36:46  8e0350878d "a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:37:16  2d2fdbd0e9 "Pierre’s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the"

 09/17/1812 Thu 21:39:27  ef2230968d "The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the"

 09/17/1812 Thu 21:42:50  4e6eeccd14 "“I can tell you more,” continued Prince Vasíli, seizing her hand,"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:43:37  a8a17e9b7d "“that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:45:59  0036273167 "of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then"
 09/17/1812 Thu 21:48:16  5eb2ffe895 "as soon as all is over,” and Prince Vasíli sighed to intimate what he"

 09/17/1812 Thu 21:52:29  98415efe82 "will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate"

 09/17/1812 Thu 21:56:46  338e9a37fe "“And our share?” asked the princess smiling ironically, as if"

 09/18/1812 Fri 02:48:50  cb650356a4 "that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the"

 09/18/1812 Fri 02:53:27  0c2b79c49a "there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet"

 09/18/1812 Fri 03:34:02  c481e9e7a0 "received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to"
 09/18/1812 Fri 03:36:22  648a822f62 "the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up"

 09/18/1812 Fri 03:47:15  c0deace001 "to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the"
