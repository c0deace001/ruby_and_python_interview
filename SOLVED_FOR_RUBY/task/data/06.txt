 10/09/1812 Fri 07:26:15  29bd181f6d "this to his daughter, but Natásha noticed her father’s nervousness"

 10/09/1812 Fri 09:13:15  04d2dcf971 "She came in to dinner with red eyes. Márya Dmítrievna, who knew how"

 10/09/1812 Fri 09:35:01  c0deace001 "would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes—how I see those"
 10/09/1812 Fri 09:36:15  b7ebd18f5c "eyes!” thought Natásha. “And what do his father and sister matter"
 10/09/1812 Fri 09:37:56  298fa148ad "to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with"

 10/09/1812 Fri 09:49:35  0af777a4c9 "patiently?” thought she, looking at Sónya, who also came in quite"

 10/09/1812 Fri 09:57:58  22eaeaf34e "love such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside her"

 10/09/1812 Fri 10:01:44  ede7c085fe "carriages, the Rostóvs’ carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:02:31  c0deace001 "squeaking over the snow. Natásha and Sónya, holding up their dresses,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:04:03  4d4ecefcfd "jumped out quickly. The count got out helped by the footmen, and,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:05:06  2174918bfc "passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:07:12  5315f09fc1 "they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes."
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:08:12  c3c07279e2 "Through the closed doors the music was already audible."

 10/09/1812 Fri 10:13:17  151b717355 "opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the"

 10/09/1812 Fri 10:17:46  3b3a7ad6dc "shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:19:02  e569ea58b5 "their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:20:58  0f4572e5f6 "at Natásha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:21:58  e118588b98 "played. Natásha, smoothing her gown, went in with Sónya and sat down,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:24:17  3f80547376 "scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sensation she had not"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:25:50  f7329e9662 "experienced for a long time—that of hundreds of eyes looking at"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:27:34  c0deace001 "her bare arms and neck—suddenly affected her both agreeably and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:28:19  56d5f911b5 "disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories, desires and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:29:08  1bd9c3be74 "emotions associated with that feeling."
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:31:05  0b8cd8b7f7 "The two remarkably pretty girls, Natásha and Sónya, with Count Rostóv"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:32:10  c0deace001 "who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted general"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:32:57  fe1cbb47d8 "attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Natásha’s engagement"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:34:02  bc359a0fc5 "to Prince Andrew, and knew that the Rostóvs had lived in the country"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:35:32  25f0ba11f6 "ever since, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancée who was making"

 10/09/1812 Fri 10:47:58  fc55793655 "to above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:48:55  90fca251c7 "unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in time to the music,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 10:49:41  1b12b6c252 "crumpling her program. “Look, there’s Alénina,” said Sónya,"

 10/09/1812 Fri 11:14:10  c0deace001 "over with an ear to Julie’s mouth, was Borís’ handsome smoothly"
 10/09/1812 Fri 11:16:16  f523e71618 "brushed head. He looked at the Rostóvs from under his brows and said"

 10/09/1812 Fri 11:28:13  55704bf6e1 "so well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly remembered all"

 10/09/1812 Fri 12:53:44  70074630b1 "The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides was"
 10/09/1812 Fri 12:55:02  5286cf4ced "some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a cloth"
 10/09/1812 Fri 12:57:24  899dfbded0 "stretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls in red"
 10/09/1812 Fri 12:57:57  e40f357eec "bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:00:00  3b697a824a "apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of green cardboard"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:00:55  ed3d4318f2 "was glued. They all sang something. When they had finished their song"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:02:00  4813fac8c5 "the girl in white went up to the prompter’s box and a man with tight"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:03:31  bdaf421e41 "silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:04:45  1fc2e39751 "went up to her and began singing, waving his arms about."
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:06:08  2446ffb4cb "First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:06:58  70a2a1bafa "both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:07:53  48de13ba60 "of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:08:46  cf871b36e4 "her. They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:10:45  f935337099 "and shouting, while the man and woman on the stage—who represented"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:12:36  45f3be679b "lovers—began smiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing."
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:14:46  ed4a5bf524 "After her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:15:44  c0deace001 "seemed grotesque and amazing to Natásha. She could not follow the opera"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:17:38  0268dacb73 "nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:19:24  782387c903 "queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:21:40  280a79bf5c "that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:22:35  aad11ccb6f "it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:24:00  c13448eb8a "for the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:25:13  7eff4c374a "audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:27:38  75ea711ad3 "herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:28:33  99adc55005 "on the stage, and expressed delight which to Natásha seemed feigned."
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:29:24  35bd29b8bd "“I suppose it has to be like this!” she thought. She kept looking"

 10/09/1812 Fri 13:32:54  7274f6fdde "the seminude women in the boxes, especially at Hélène in the next box,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:35:07  79ae9fca46 "who—apparently quite unclothed—sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:36:18  3393da778a "taking her eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:38:28  c0deace001 "the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natásha little"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:39:23  ac1984d659 "by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:41:28  f265893f97 "experienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:43:55  175c5b3acc "was, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought, the"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:45:15  0576ccc834 "strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:45:47  abeabbb7c3 "mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:47:07  35d880fef3 "singing the air the actress was singing, then she wished to touch with"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:49:12  f47608dc7d "her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to lean over to"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:50:38  7fbae40ef6 "Hélène and tickle her."
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:52:18  78e408fecf "At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song, a door"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:54:40  cf1fd7df8f "leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostóvs’ box creaked,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:56:21  27f9b53254 "and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. “There’s Kurágin!”"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:57:22  48d3fc7104 "whispered Shinshín. Countess Bezúkhova turned smiling to the newcomer,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 13:58:57  aedb47c32f "and Natásha, following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:00:18  c845e781e3 "handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:01:47  856f9c7f79 "courteous bearing. This was Anatole Kurágin whom she had seen"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:02:35  8ff2a6da13 "and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was now in an"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:03:12  7c3a09f20b "adjutant’s uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot. He moved with"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:03:49  4c5fb1f2ef "a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:06:16  c8bda9d1d5 "so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:07:18  80d87328ec "of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:08:50  7cb86df90d "proceeding, he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:10:00  f531c28b05 "and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high."
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:10:57  303fc049ff "Having looked at Natásha he approached his sister, laid his well gloved"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:12:46  dfbc7c020b "hand on the edge of her box, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:14:09  0d359ce921 "question, with a motion toward Natásha."
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:16:10  971b13791e "“Mais charmante!” said he, evidently referring to Natásha, who did"

 10/09/1812 Fri 14:17:53  9659677c17 "lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:18:34  842c4d7a18 "beside Dólokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:19:48  fc683cfbcc "that Dólokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:20:47  f7a4557c80 "smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra screen."
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:23:04  21bfce915f "“How like the brother is to the sister,” remarked the count. “And"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:24:07  2b66a72ecc "how handsome they both are!”"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:25:48  a33ecf8a2e "Shinshín, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some intrigue"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:27:59  d18a7d4393 "of Kurágin’s in Moscow, and Natásha tried to overhear it just"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:29:44  82fd43cde9 "because he had said she was “charmante.”"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:30:52  80236b5ee3 "The first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about, going"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:31:51  4303a84d94 "out and coming in."
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:32:46  cbf2d63948 "Borís came to the Rostóvs’ box, received their congratulations very"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:33:46  c0deace001 "simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:35:12  fab52e9b6d "Natásha and Sónya his fiancée’s invitation to her wedding, and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:37:18  8a0a8c7f3c "went away. Natásha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:38:20  8b19645122 "congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Borís with whom"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:40:45  50a1014c0a "she had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:43:01  36c1532149 "everything seemed simple and natural."
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:44:03  55d170ca62 "The scantily clad Hélène smiled at everyone in the same way, and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:46:27  73b3bdbf24 "Natásha gave Borís a similar smile."
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:48:32  1e63b98892 "Hélène’s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:50:06  a5690b49db "distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:51:32  1dc9e6b8ed "in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her."
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:52:17  a9fa4b89c3 "During the whole of that entr’acte Kurágin stood with Dólokhov"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:54:11  e111912ed9 "in front of the orchestra partition, looking at the Rostóvs’ box."
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:54:56  31df9708e4 "Natásha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure."
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:56:27  3c14a0b32e "She even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:57:44  b6b7e46d1a "was its most becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act"
 10/09/1812 Fri 14:59:00  50b5d74c91 "Pierre appeared in the stalls. The Rostóvs had not seen him since"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:00:51  01f08ebe79 "their arrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:02:12  8a4a879aa1 "Natásha last saw him. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:03:40  6454c69416 "anyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him, looking at and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:04:15  1304feb7a5 "indicating the Rostóvs’ box. On seeing Natásha Pierre grew animated"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:05:57  fc28b37ccd "and, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their box. When he"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:07:04  2c645e8bb8 "got there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to her for a long"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:08:04  3a3724a23b "time. While conversing with Pierre, Natásha heard a man’s voice in"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:08:49  0a3b99e84f "Countess Bezúkhova’s box and something told her it was Kurágin. She"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:09:37  400e1496a4 "turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed straight into her"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:11:52  03c7ceeef7 "eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:13:16  9cf9413d06 "so near him, to look at him like that, to be so sure he admired her, and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:14:34  3a77fb7724 "not to be acquainted with him."
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:15:14  5863f702e6 "In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:17:00  f6038071fd "round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:17:59  225ff669fe "the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:19:27  0a055b05df "people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:20:41  28c7ba8601 "things like daggers in their hands. They began waving their arms. Then"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:22:04  b1098fe377 "some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:23:19  c0deace001 "in white and was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:25:14  54576ce3e3 "but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:26:23  88e7af22fe "behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:28:51  9078329d10 "everyone knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:29:43  ef1a4d7266 "interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience."
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:31:48  cede924162 "During this act every time Natásha looked toward the stalls she saw"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:32:24  3208cf8527 "Anatole Kurágin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair,"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:34:32  5bae6dd47d "staring at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:36:45  b494a887a5 "it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it."
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:38:22  85f71868ff "When the second act was over Countess Bezúkhova rose, turned to the"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:39:09  89f044bace "Rostóvs’ box—her whole bosom completely exposed—beckoned the old"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:40:00  63a7595e96 "count with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had"

 10/09/1812 Fri 15:51:24  2bc9c8e7c0 "Countess Bezúkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:52:41  57f6ee2542 "woman. She could say what she did not think—especially what was"
 10/09/1812 Fri 15:53:47  74df39508f "flattering—quite simply and naturally."

 10/09/1812 Fri 16:06:27  787edb0d30 "emphasis, implying that she knew of his relation to Natásha. To get"
 10/09/1812 Fri 16:07:49  ac1958f376 "better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come"

 10/09/1812 Fri 16:18:55  4f2e8af1ba "and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had been first in white"
 10/09/1812 Fri 16:20:45  6bf5f733e2 "and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the"

 10/12/1812 Mon 02:05:38  353821b740 "he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:07:56  dbb94fc2f8 "letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykóv and had"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:09:23  850ab2f62f "told Balashëv to repeat to Napoleon. Balashëv remembered these words,"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:10:42  623f2beb21 "“So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,” but some"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:11:31  155f921ec6 "complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though he"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:12:28  b26f78ca6e "wished to do so. He grew confused and said: “On condition that the"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:14:48  c0deace001 "French army retires beyond the Niemen.”"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:15:53  a0aa12dc2c "Napoleon noticed Balashëv’s embarrassment when uttering these last"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:16:29  9703170626 "words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:18:50  b1984166cc "rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:19:53  54284e17a8 "a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:21:59  cf251e615b "followed, Balashëv, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:23:06  7a05948bd1 "noticed the quivering of Napoleon’s left leg which increased the more"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:25:11  b825676804 "Napoleon raised his voice."
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:25:48  0ec4a899d4 "“I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,” he began. “Have"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:26:20  de5f759d89 "I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:26:50  c0deace001 "have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:28:15  48e968d6ce "negotiations, what is demanded of me?” he said, frowning and making an"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:30:35  89180902a4 "energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand."
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:31:13  a49bbae76d "“The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,” replied Balashëv."
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:33:19  40d2c35884 "“The Niemen?” repeated Napoleon. “So now you want me to retire beyond"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:35:33  0800813b2f "the Niemen—only the Niemen?” repeated Napoleon, looking straight at"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:37:25  a7f5039527 "Balashëv."
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:39:38  829c47575c "The latter bowed his head respectfully."
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:41:47  59c757c544 "Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania,"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:43:46  c0deace001 "only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:46:14  4d7e1df5ee "quickly and began to pace the room."

 10/12/1812 Mon 02:49:09  4d82230b7e "before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:51:25  3505337d16 "the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder,"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:53:14  bfe206d579 "and yet you are willing to negotiate.”"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:53:59  328fdaaf77 "He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:54:34  428ec8c848 "stopped in front of Balashëv. Balashëv noticed that his left leg was"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:56:50  febbbdfe73 "quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern"
 10/12/1812 Mon 02:59:17  2b2c6671b8 "expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:00:38  5bafcc4746 "conscious of. “The vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,”"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:01:21  c07aa58c0c "he remarked at a later date."
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:03:46  54c8c66481 "“Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to a"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:04:58  c64513b315 "Prince of Baden, but not to me!” Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:06:06  5d7a6b9f9e "own surprise. “If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:07:59  cce310fd8f "such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:09:48  c0deace001 "army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:11:41  5608c294ff "have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:13:33  8e7185fc33 "your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:14:09  b627d02f25 "aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?” he continued"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:16:09  5e0d53932b "hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:16:48  d112f6cc66 "and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:19:14  2a5409f55b "power and Alexander’s errors and duplicity."
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:21:15  1288d3c405 "The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:23:22  2001b1e36a "intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:25:24  0329b6698e "that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking,"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:26:47  c4bc93cb1e "and the more he talked the less could he control his words."
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:28:29  36c159fb74 "The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:30:11  5028212d6c "insult Alexander—just what he had least desired at the commencement of"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:31:04  76b5504e4f "the interview."
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:33:27  23a8912dc7 "“I hear you have made peace with Turkey?”"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:35:07  29525154f0 "Balashëv bowed his head affirmatively."
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:36:22  ff29b41a57 "“Peace has been concluded...” he began."
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:38:03  1d2f182966 "But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:39:21  915c7783fb "talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:39:55  c3ea6c00a8 "unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone."
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:41:43  f94818fa77 "“Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:43:06  523cb7edeb "Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:45:19  e7c74aa6cf "provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,” he went on, “I promised and would"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:47:04  23448aadd5 "have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:49:19  4de8f0d22e "won’t have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:51:45  a7646e9291 "his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia from the"

 10/12/1812 Mon 03:54:14  4cdee7d19f "not have done more,” said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:55:11  b4c95321be "paced up and down the room, repeating to Balashëv almost the very words"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:55:59  d2f4208bc4 "he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. “All that, he would have"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:58:08  ce63e02f56 "owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!” he repeated several"
 10/12/1812 Mon 03:59:18  3b731821ac "times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to"
 10/12/1812 Mon 04:01:29  bceed35710 "his nose, and greedily sniffed at it."
 10/12/1812 Mon 04:02:52  0586553ef0 "“What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander’s might have been!”"
 10/12/1812 Mon 04:04:08  c9787c85de "He looked compassionately at Balashëv, and as soon as the latter tried"
 10/12/1812 Mon 04:05:41  f5d222dcab "to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him."
 10/12/1812 Mon 04:07:05  8e7b8692e7 "“What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained"

 10/12/1812 Mon 04:41:33  b5f072b1a6 "these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander"
 10/12/1812 Mon 04:43:06  17b72195a2 "desired to be a military commander."

 10/12/1812 Mon 05:16:30  137f177da6 "to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which"
 10/12/1812 Mon 05:17:55  c2730b261f "a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is"
 10/12/1812 Mon 05:18:25  f67d2e3681 "in the right. Balashëv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared"
 10/12/1812 Mon 05:20:12  320d96e1b5 "to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man,"
 10/12/1812 Mon 05:22:00  088d8f6726 "he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently"
 10/12/1812 Mon 05:22:47  98a827b0a9 "seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon"

 10/12/1812 Mon 05:26:25  5cfa087661 "when he came to his senses. Balashëv stood with downcast eyes, looking"

 10/12/1812 Mon 05:36:29  78504ba79e "And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this"
