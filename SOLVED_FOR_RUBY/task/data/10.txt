 10/26/1812 Mon 20:33:16  a902a716bc "She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that"
 10/26/1812 Mon 20:35:21  2f5cd2204e "came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed to her now"
 10/26/1812 Mon 20:37:13  bb1f5cb121 "as real as any other recollection. She not only remembered what she had"
 10/26/1812 Mon 20:39:01  28d2407025 "then said—that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with"
 10/26/1812 Mon 20:39:40  c0deace001 "something red—but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said"
 10/26/1812 Mon 20:41:26  1c5d4d9444 "that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed."
 10/26/1812 Mon 20:43:30  877917323e "“Yes, yes, it really was pink!” cried Natásha, who now thought she"

 10/26/1812 Mon 21:06:35  743abd2bea "Sónya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words. Those"
 10/26/1812 Mon 21:08:46  ddea9ff151 "eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and"
 10/26/1812 Mon 21:10:24  cfaba06dfb "readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal."
 10/26/1812 Mon 21:11:21  b5fff5b18c "Sónya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand."

 10/26/1812 Mon 21:20:51  02b1989f4f "was joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in"
 10/26/1812 Mon 21:23:08  60cb28c98e "which she was accustomed to live and loved to live. So with a joyful"

 10/26/1812 Mon 21:43:17  399e73fb34 "who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had"

 10/26/1812 Mon 21:49:05  2e5377f7be "and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke French, which struck them as"
 10/26/1812 Mon 21:50:59  b58d139932 "surprisingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the"
 10/26/1812 Mon 21:51:53  51f1d2e87b "other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was"
 10/26/1812 Mon 21:52:45  7ef7f16e5e "required by an officer."

 10/26/1812 Mon 21:58:34  77d39865e5 "he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him."
 10/26/1812 Mon 21:59:09  c0deace001 "That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among"

 10/26/1812 Mon 22:05:45  72e9f17276 "and which is supposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:06:27  01603ea91c "was questioned as to who he was, where he had been, with what object,"

 10/26/1812 Mon 22:13:09  7ce4632165 "the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:14:19  d018dc7676 "the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as Pierre began to say"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:14:59  881fedf708 "anything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel was removed and"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:17:08  0c8b7a32b2 "the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:17:50  6bcd305f1d "always feel at their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:18:24  ceaf286c4d "put to him. He had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:20:20  95cb456663 "kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed. He"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:21:55  9655fa5060 "knew he was in these men’s power, that only by force had they brought"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:22:36  ab75e80696 "him there, that force alone gave them the right to demand answers"

 10/26/1812 Mon 22:24:57  a9aabfbd37 "inculpate him. And so, as they had the power and wish to inculpate"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:26:21  dd6f599738 "him, this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary. It was"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:28:05  3b0c059847 "evident that any answer would lead to conviction. When asked what he"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:29:05  f267fca7a4 "was doing when he was arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:30:54  5102dc02f8 "that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:33:00  e5e63721b3 "flames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he “was"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:33:36  b27ec02601 "protecting a woman,” and that “to protect a woman who was being insulted"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:35:06  c0deace001 "was the duty of every man; that...” They interrupted him, for this"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:35:39  0e5c96abc7 "was not to the point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:36:29  dbaf982db1 "witnesses had seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:37:48  691e68cd29 "was happening in Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:38:49  3e7d8bfe0f "where he was going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they"
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:40:45  2798df07ac "asked, repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer."
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:41:52  439a2c3dc6 "Again he replied that he could not answer it."
 10/26/1812 Mon 22:43:04  c0deace001 "“Put that down, that’s bad... very bad,” sternly remarked the general"

 10/27/1812 Tue 00:21:52  960bde5e9f "and that they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself"

 10/27/1812 Tue 00:34:53  38fc3cc1da "soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of Eckmühl (Davout)."
 10/27/1812 Tue 00:37:15  ab711f5181 "They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one."
 10/27/1812 Tue 00:38:12  dc888953c9 "Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass gallery,"

 10/27/1812 Tue 00:49:14  1e55cfb6cc "a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 00:51:00  d20bcaddba "he said in a low voice:"
 10/27/1812 Tue 00:53:12  6d76f17274 "“Who are you?”"
 10/27/1812 Tue 00:54:55  ead250ed96 "Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To him"

 10/27/1812 Tue 00:58:40  feb96280bc "cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster"
 10/27/1812 Tue 00:59:11  452c3a64c3 "who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:00:34  8137051d24 "instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:01:42  c0deace001 "to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:02:45  0014dcd826 "examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:03:43  fcca774295 "embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had decided what to do,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:05:23  3f0e5e23ba "Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back on his forehead,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:05:58  65a95629dd "screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him."
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:06:59  bffe7c17ba "“I know that man,” he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:09:27  0becb2be29 "calculated to frighten Pierre."
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:11:14  2769b7406e "The chill that had been running down Pierre’s back now seized his head"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:12:06  7406d6e17a "as in a vise."
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:14:22  e46425511f "“You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...”"

 10/27/1812 Tue 01:22:08  0380afa75e "“No, monseigneur,” he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke."

 10/27/1812 Tue 01:26:18  71628636a4 "“Your name?” asked Davout."

 10/27/1812 Tue 01:31:39  681f411e10 "“Monseigneur!” exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a pleading"

 10/27/1812 Tue 01:33:44  c0deace001 "Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they looked"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:34:36  50fbbb3329 "at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of war"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:36:44  139a943979 "and law, that look established human relations between the two men. At"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:37:49  60eadad6c5 "that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:39:54  561cd9d3ff "minds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:41:55  f8dc8fac90 "were brothers."
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:43:53  ad1982cd9f "At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:44:28  1901737b4f "papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:46:49  b3071736c5 "was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:47:20  02640d130b "burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:48:23  ed4e72ea01 "human being. He reflected for a moment."
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:49:46  f243554ee8 "“How can you show me that you are telling the truth?” said Davout"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:50:23  ed3b48272f "coldly."
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:51:49  3174cb55bb "Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the"

 10/27/1812 Tue 01:54:48  db351a6900 "“You are not what you say,” returned Davout."
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:56:37  77d085649a "In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the"
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:57:37  846315ad1d "truth of his statements."
 10/27/1812 Tue 01:59:59  e00081cb5b "But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout."
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:01:25  8055e163a0 "Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:01:58  27e9cf5f1d "buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre."
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:02:57  ff0e7cda1a "When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head in"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:04:45  9e615f8fa4 "Pierre’s direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:06:43  e1f8d5b7d9 "where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:08:47  c0deace001 "or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:10:01  d1b2b65706 "they crossed the Virgin’s Field."
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:10:40  6020d5979e "He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another"

 10/27/1812 Tue 02:14:18  6917a8a3cc "“Yes, of course!” replied Davout, but what this “yes” meant, Pierre did"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:15:22  4743685dbe "not know."
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:16:07  c2e8edf9dd "Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was far, or"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:18:16  d08eb2caf7 "in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was stupefied,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:18:50  c0deace001 "and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:20:26  04c528aa2b "did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:22:31  77a5020639 "mind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:23:11  fb971bddb5 "death? Not the men on the commission that had first examined him—not one"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:24:52  fe5a2cd275 "of them wished to or, evidently, could have done it. It was not Davout,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:26:41  fe5e27ee0b "who had looked at him in so human a way. In another moment Davout would"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:27:15  577976367f "have realized that he was doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:29:21  6e1f70298e "come in and interrupted him. The adjutant, also, had evidently had no"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:29:55  54a9989b54 "evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in. Then who was"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:30:28  b0191f25f5 "executing him, killing him, depriving him of life—him, Pierre, with all"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:31:30  c0deace001 "his memories, aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:33:19  9284cb3503 "Pierre felt that it was no one."
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:35:32  c0deace001 "It was a system—a concurrence of circumstances."

 10/27/1812 Tue 02:45:48  e026fbbfdc "in which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:47:25  d26aa5db3c "dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:49:14  fb5a6478ec "in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:51:01  525e857fd4 "of Napoleon’s soldiers who were not on duty—Germans, Italians, and"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:52:47  edcb46126d "Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of the post"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:53:50  919aea4102 "stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:54:54  c0deace001 "boots and shakos."
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:56:04  2868227e01 "The prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:56:47  2e062e4131 "(Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums suddenly"
 10/27/1812 Tue 02:59:04  85ca253315 "began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre felt as"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:00:57  a97491b9a4 "if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of thinking or"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:02:46  cd0a9cc4dc "understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only one wish—that"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:04:31  4f30239c81 "the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly. Pierre"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:06:34  1330a27351 "looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them."
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:07:26  3068e13e77 "The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:08:22  5b7b971277 "the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:10:21  584546d734 "a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:12:49  c8d76bc841 "plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:13:49  6ee7a185fe "man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes. The fifth was a"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:15:51  33cf85073a "factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat."
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:16:43  1369e3896e "Pierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately or"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:18:31  5cd092942c "two at a time. “In couples,” replied the officer in command in a calm"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:19:52  9ec9ec86f9 "voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:20:28  c0d28811af "that they were all hurrying—not as men hurry to do something they"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:21:26  9770d886c2 "understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:23:51  9aaee4b7f6 "incomprehensible task."

 10/27/1812 Tue 03:36:07  d2e955489a "and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:38:20  255f8c183d "the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and"

 10/27/1812 Tue 03:42:48  f21671b68a "to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:43:29  9d0ff27686 "noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:44:57  d5393d82a6 "thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:45:42  22dc1a9c4b "were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands."
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:47:42  2a0e275cf9 "Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:48:17  43effe97b1 "these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:50:28  e3502c42d4 "protection in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:52:42  e81fc28664 "what was going to happen to them. They could not believe it because they"
 10/27/1812 Tue 03:53:43  968888030b "alone knew what their life meant to them, and so they neither understood"

 10/27/1812 Tue 04:00:19  0fd27e5964 "he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:02:46  c0deace001 "were again doing something by the post, their trembling hands impeding"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:04:42  7ad898c08d "one another. Pierre, breathing heavily, looked around as if asking what"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:05:15  08704a229d "it meant. The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his."

 10/27/1812 Tue 04:19:19  c42cd4814d "him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:21:43  3df9ec1c82 "and shook himself free.) The lad was unable to walk. They dragged him"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:23:57  2054dc96ee "along, holding him up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:24:38  36ea36da8b "him to the post he grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something."

 10/27/1812 Tue 04:32:12  79ccc4aa5c "Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:34:00  3d191238ed "and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:35:50  1976746b10 "at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he"

 10/27/1812 Tue 04:38:34  5b7b988c34 "When they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which"

 10/27/1812 Tue 04:41:22  942b2fb63e "bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in that"

 10/27/1812 Tue 04:52:14  1aabd732d7 "itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of the"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:53:32  c0deace001 "hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally"
 10/27/1812 Tue 04:55:51  e805938c0f "and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one hindered"

 10/27/1812 Tue 05:46:25  68846a5d86 "able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a"

 10/27/1812 Tue 06:09:39  59f917fd82 "replies, nor how they would understand them. He looked at their faces"
 10/27/1812 Tue 06:10:28  059daf05ac "and figures, but they all seemed to him equally meaningless."

 10/27/1812 Tue 06:50:06  31e756f89a "murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he opened"
 10/27/1812 Tue 06:52:26  cb0da8cadc "his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him."

 10/27/1812 Tue 06:57:46  26342a9390 "him every time he moved. This man was doing something to his legs in the"

 10/27/1812 Tue 06:59:59  0dd01c29e1 "continually glanced at him. On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw"
 10/27/1812 Tue 07:01:27  53a16a2f6d "that the man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused"

 10/27/1812 Tue 07:06:24  045e2ac3b4 "at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the other was already"
 10/27/1812 Tue 07:07:00  3c5d220a9b "unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way, having carefully"

 10/27/1812 Tue 07:11:00  a27780cc76 "one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs"
 10/27/1812 Tue 07:11:59  1d96cdff48 "fixed above his head. Then he took out a knife, cut something, closed"
 10/27/1812 Tue 07:14:10  027429df6f "the knife, placed it under the head of his bed, and, seating himself"
 10/27/1812 Tue 07:16:00  d1aae8aa1e "comfortably, clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes"

 10/27/1812 Tue 07:28:36  a21ebafbc5 "“Eh, lad, don’t fret!” said he, in the tender singsong caressing voice"

 10/27/1812 Tue 07:46:09  bfb9b12024 "“Here, eat a bit, sir,” said he, resuming his former respectful tone as"

 10/27/1812 Tue 08:45:38  d4f50fa512 "“Who? I?” said Karatáev. “I say things happen not as we plan but as God"

 10/27/1812 Tue 08:58:46  c4a9cec467 "questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that"
 10/27/1812 Tue 09:00:02  a21a366548 "he had no mother."

 10/27/1812 Tue 09:06:17  455f63e0b7 "Again Pierre’s negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened"

 10/27/1812 Tue 10:25:52  6664e5cd4b "inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep, but"

 10/27/1812 Tue 10:45:42  ce05ae4180 "soldier’s cap, and bast shoes—was round. His head was quite round, his"

 10/27/1812 Tue 10:47:59  e3f156fcec "ready to embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his"

 10/27/1812 Tue 10:54:05  4c1d6806e1 "know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly"

 10/27/1812 Tue 11:01:16  a24ab1fd72 "His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of"
 10/27/1812 Tue 11:02:21  357fb70efe "innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief"
 10/27/1812 Tue 11:03:31  276dd13a5d "peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It was"
 10/27/1812 Tue 11:04:02  2cd3f43c86 "evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 11:06:02  7b417c3640 "and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an"
 10/27/1812 Tue 11:07:49  fa89d41fc2 "irresistible persuasiveness."

 10/27/1812 Tue 11:15:26  0580754391 "up, he said: “I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake myself.” And"
 10/27/1812 Tue 11:16:39  d06f85a9f2 "indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he"

 10/27/1812 Tue 11:24:40  6fb8140eed "planed, and mended boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed"
 10/27/1812 Tue 11:25:32  1ead93aca0 "himself conversation—of which he was fond—and songs. He did not sing"

 10/27/1812 Tue 12:02:03  9ca5bd23a3 "character of solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the"

 10/27/1812 Tue 16:20:14  f121e57b54 "that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for others,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:21:39  e8cfbd5132 "and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them. It was"
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:22:23  a6cd2d611a "plain that at that moment there was in Natásha’s heart no thought of"

 10/27/1812 Tue 16:23:30  c949c51996 "Princess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at the"
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:24:14  715a623695 "first glance at Natásha’s face, and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful"
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:26:16  1b3bab608d "pleasure."
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:28:02  cafed488b4 "“Come, come to him, Mary,” said Natásha, leading her into the other"

 10/27/1812 Tue 16:35:27  2b4eb47ecb "She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words."
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:37:20  efb2442e2c "Natásha’s face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and"

 10/27/1812 Tue 16:41:25  236aec066f "Natásha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say"
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:41:59  399fcc6424 "all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes"
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:42:47  807159cdfd "which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was impossible"
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:44:40  332eb46781 "not to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly, Natásha’s lips"
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:46:29  9bd51dc45b "twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face"
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:47:42  c6635d2bed "with her hands she burst into sobs."
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:49:20  088992f75a "Princess Mary understood."
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:50:19  0dc5eaf3a6 "But she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:"

 10/27/1812 Tue 16:53:28  bbc314830d "“You, you... will see,” was all Natásha could say."
 10/27/1812 Tue 16:54:50  4a6b21f4c0 "They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off"

 10/27/1812 Tue 17:00:24  352548553b "Natásha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:02:07  b948abc335 "condition and the pain he suffered, but at Tróitsa that had passed"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:03:43  02c6c51dfb "and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger had also"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:04:20  f02903f6c3 "passed. When they reached Yaroslávl the wound had begun to fester"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:06:18  ac4fa4007f "(Natásha knew all about such things as festering) and the doctor had"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:07:18  b05af2d536 "said that the festering might take a normal course. Then fever set in,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:09:11  a68cb8e1d9 "but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious."
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:10:35  caf9f7a10d "“But two days ago this suddenly happened,” said Natásha, struggling with"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:11:56  f29ec22a34 "her sobs. “I don’t know why, but you will see what he is like.”"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:13:51  8930076e40 "“Is he weaker? Thinner?” asked the princess."

 10/27/1812 Tue 17:18:28  bb195c7638 "When Natásha opened Prince Andrew’s door with a familiar movement and"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:20:43  c0deace001 "let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:21:26  7093fe7c45 "sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:23:32  5e4b4d705d "tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at"

 10/27/1812 Tue 17:26:22  5165d9bd87 "The princess understood what Natásha had meant by the words: “two days"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:27:51  e8ad5a6d85 "ago this suddenly happened.” She understood those words to mean that he"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:28:59  8e8614d2ed "had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:30:36  b325c9f0cd "of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:31:06  6c30bdc07a "imagination Andrew’s face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:32:43  1d4c61f62f "mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:34:32  180d215d97 "affected her very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:36:51  2fd31cf3fd "words to her such as her father had uttered before his death, and"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:39:13  c08507ec48 "that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:40:08  e48350f5bd "presence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, and she went in. The sobs"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:41:26  7643f3df1d "rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:42:52  b287fc5d93 "distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:43:49  912266197d "features, and then she saw his face and met his gaze."
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:44:20  7f02e460bd "He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:46:45  d4e4db154f "pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:47:49  ba92d63ce8 "he held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:49:40  49673e8a45 "mustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:50:35  c0deace001 "as they entered."
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:51:13  f819bfdc9a "On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary’s pace suddenly"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:52:52  5c96c77eaf "slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She suddenly"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:54:44  6f9ef27455 "felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and"
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:56:16  efe2d9211b "eyes."
 10/27/1812 Tue 17:58:08  087ba80872 "“But in what am I to blame?” she asked herself. And his cold, stern look"

 10/27/1812 Tue 18:00:47  209d387127 "In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:02:16  3e81dadeb6 "was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:03:39  bd1d142546 "Natásha."
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:04:31  59db019f08 "He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont."
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:05:37  098b31a850 "“How are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?” said he in a voice"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:06:27  c8cb1bda5b "as calm and aloof as his look."
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:07:35  0cd6089942 "Had he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such horror"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:09:32  129c62b24d "into Princess Mary’s heart as the tone of his voice."
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:11:01  000f537ad5 "“And have you brought little Nicholas?” he asked in the same slow, quiet"

 10/27/1812 Tue 18:15:13  7332441319 "“How are you now?” said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she was"

 10/27/1812 Tue 18:27:03  7c03e7c328 "Princess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:29:29  c0deace001 "perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She now"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:30:33  f5366f1cc1 "understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words, his"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:31:25  8db2bfb5a5 "tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look could be"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:33:14  90d9aaf893 "felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world, terrible"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:34:35  5d3606b25a "in one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he understand"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:35:17  1e42350638 "anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to understand, not"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:37:06  1eb0a6496a "because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:37:36  3b062ba7cd "else—something the living did not and could not understand—and which"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:39:40  c9efac979d "wholly occupied his mind."
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:40:32  6cd41d7d5d "“There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,” said he,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:42:17  e138c63604 "breaking the silence and pointing to Natásha. “She looks after me all"

 10/27/1812 Tue 18:45:20  c65bce7a33 "thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:47:31  5943c8e336 "before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:48:39  d9d9b8526e "could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone. If he had"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:49:51  2ec7686331 "not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to pity her and"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:52:15  13da256fb6 "how could he speak like that in her presence? The only explanation was"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:54:01  243fb3e63c "that he was indifferent, because something else, much more important,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:54:41  dbeaefbf23 "had been revealed to him."
 10/27/1812 Tue 18:55:56  e4ca5c0a86 "The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off."

 10/27/1812 Tue 19:05:18  bb8aafe07d "Natásha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was"
 10/27/1812 Tue 19:07:06  d2beb784ba "making an effort to listen, but could not do so."
 10/27/1812 Tue 19:08:18  11c66692d9 "“Yes, they say it’s burned,” he said. “It’s a great pity,” and he gazed"

 10/27/1812 Tue 19:11:22  c0deace001 "“And so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?” Prince Andrew suddenly said,"
 10/27/1812 Tue 19:13:23  086d722298 "evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. “He wrote here that he"
 10/27/1812 Tue 19:15:22  b42fc49f29 "took a great liking to you,” he went on simply and calmly, evidently"
 10/27/1812 Tue 19:17:44  2a17bb1cad "unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for"
 10/27/1812 Tue 19:18:36  84f736c160 "living people. “If you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you"
 10/27/1812 Tue 19:20:39  a232d128a3 "to get married,” he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having"

 10/27/1812 Tue 19:23:05  1779b00224 "Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her, except as"

 10/27/1812 Tue 19:26:30  3a024f4d32 "“Why talk of me?” she said quietly and glanced at Natásha."

 10/27/1812 Tue 19:43:06  c77db9ead1 "irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last"

 10/27/1812 Tue 19:47:54  55cb025285 "his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else"

 10/27/1812 Tue 19:55:45  3eb4440f64 "to cry."
 10/27/1812 Tue 19:56:49  0171f4d64a "He looked at her attentively."

 10/27/1812 Tue 20:13:37  3bbfa3cba7 "a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their"

 10/27/1812 Tue 23:26:11  25f9375b4b "were too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former"

 10/27/1812 Tue 23:40:49  31f24fca6f "empty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to"
 10/27/1812 Tue 23:42:23  97b6702fe4 "disappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded"

 10/27/1812 Tue 23:53:37  943e98f19b "breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the"

 10/29/1812 Thu 06:08:29  6e23a44776 "involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal’s changed face,"

 10/29/1812 Thu 06:12:02  61ccc76306 "drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled"
 10/29/1812 Thu 06:13:47  3052e0b967 "people against their will to kill their fellow men—that force the effect"

 10/29/1812 Thu 06:19:04  09a289a10e "served as its tools, was useless. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait"

 10/29/1812 Thu 06:59:13  2812e50693 "shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major"
 10/29/1812 Thu 07:00:04  ff26e56582 "with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a Kazán dressing"

 10/29/1812 Thu 07:03:21  6e15794392 "his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco"

 10/29/1812 Thu 07:06:24  8606182e4d "pipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and"
