 11/03/1812 Tue 21:25:45  7ae20a8fca "inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well."
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:27:18  2bd5dfccbf "In another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:28:02  046474caa8 "was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:30:21  54d5c75e30 "to buy back Otrádnoe—that being his pet dream."
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:30:55  d27eaab09a "Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:32:57  c0deace001 "that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:33:45  ba3096c8a5 "a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:34:37  eefd288d92 "then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:36:46  22d53e95fa "management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products,"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:37:36  2087f642dc "and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any"

 11/03/1812 Tue 21:40:29  2e29a76509 "mind’s eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it. The"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:42:28  e49894b210 "chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:43:08  67bd7d7aa2 "in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important"

 11/03/1812 Tue 21:46:18  d03048a7dc "effective—the peasant laborer. When Nicholas first began farming"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:47:47  7e612f4479 "and began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:49:33  bfb3b8afd3 "especially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:50:10  c5b10c7dd1 "a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At first"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:52:30  0927b8fdc8 "he watched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and what they"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:54:01  36660d5872 "considered good and bad, and only pretended to direct them and give"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:55:00  82f9073d94 "orders while in reality learning from them their methods, their manner"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:56:51  6f37dba956 "of speech, and their judgment of what was good and bad. Only when he"
 11/03/1812 Tue 21:57:51  0b761188ae "had understood the peasants’ tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:00:12  97bf70becb "their language, to grasp the hidden meaning of their words, and felt"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:02:12  9d0ba28ad2 "akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:04:36  00e2ab1f83 "perform toward them the duties demanded of him. And Nicholas’ management"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:06:34  e41cea95f9 "produced very brilliant results."
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:07:04  7332bcb45c "Guided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the"

 11/03/1812 Tue 22:10:45  ef748e397f "had the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:12:24  c0deace001 "analyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:13:54  4aefbc88f0 "credit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:14:57  c3a5638935 "peasants had and increased the number by all possible means. He kept the"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:17:00  9515677556 "peasant families together in the largest groups possible, not allowing"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:18:48  ab866a2b39 "the family groups to divide into separate households. He was hard alike"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:20:13  b89f338434 "on the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled"

 11/03/1812 Tue 22:34:19  f5917845bc "had to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:35:15  4e81e08045 "the house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:36:03  6e79ae7fea "instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He"
 11/03/1812 Tue 22:37:28  8666a06447 "never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his"

 11/05/1812 Thu 06:06:43  9e396887c4 "a quite peculiar way. Natásha was so used to this kind of talk with her"

 11/05/1812 Thu 07:17:17  9ceb30f83a "till he has read what he had already bought—Sismondi and Rousseau and"
 11/05/1812 Thu 07:19:10  324138179e "Montesquieu,” he added with a smile. “You know how much I...” he began"
 11/05/1812 Thu 07:20:03  ad839faa1c "to soften down what he had said; but Natásha interrupted him to show"

 11/05/1812 Thu 07:26:26  e9a5538283 "saw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all else is"

 11/05/1812 Thu 07:35:27  97af789a82 "says we ought not to think. But I can’t help it. Besides, when I was in"
 11/05/1812 Thu 07:37:53  fee7f662f0 "Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go"
 11/05/1812 Thu 07:40:04  cf5974f0e5 "to pieces without me—everyone was pulling his own way. But I succeeded"

 11/05/1812 Thu 08:03:39  6d6b9cc122 "“Platón Karatáev?” he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely"

 11/05/1812 Thu 08:11:10  c0deace001 "he would have approved of is our family life. He was always so anxious"
 11/05/1812 Thu 08:13:31  75b4ddfa90 "to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should"
 11/05/1812 Thu 08:15:55  9d60d3a191 "have been proud to let him see us. There now—you talk of my absence,"

 11/05/1812 Thu 09:37:10  3b12ac3e55 "his Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white"

 11/05/1812 Thu 09:46:25  c0deace001 "entangled and it grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before"
