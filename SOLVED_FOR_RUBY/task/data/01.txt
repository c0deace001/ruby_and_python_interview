 09/20/1812 Sun 00:36:57  eab919c2d9 "liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 00:39:11  5b44260fa6 "stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room."
 09/20/1812 Sun 00:40:03  1c9649d5ab "Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he"
 09/20/1812 Sun 00:41:32  2291aeb327 "had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 00:43:27  c0deace001 "in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former"
 09/20/1812 Sun 00:45:02  beee8307bd "affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time"

 09/20/1812 Sun 00:46:56  9328c36039 "agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed more satisfaction"
 09/20/1812 Sun 00:48:15  e4fed75333 "with himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter"
 09/20/1812 Sun 00:48:59  99bd045d75 "and more attractive."
 09/20/1812 Sun 00:50:02  79a7a6a7d0 "Kutúzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 00:52:30  5d3979fa56 "promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants,"

 09/20/1812 Sun 01:03:10  1ae32055a7 "generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:05:30  6f7da4326c "quite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:06:18  d8ad0800f5 "different from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:08:00  0a81c8d4c0 "of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:09:23  7facd88a83 "Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:10:48  9453d24603 "considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people"

 09/20/1812 Sun 01:35:08  bf855588ed "who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door."
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:37:11  5e13fc8670 "Prince Andrew stopped short."
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:38:14  58bf148c7c "“Commander in Chief Kutúzov?” said the newly arrived general"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:40:12  6759589432 "speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:41:32  5572d6a426 "advancing straight toward the inner door."
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:42:02  0e793a6a76 "“The commander in chief is engaged,” said Kozlóvski, going"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:42:58  c5e1c67c1e "hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door."
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:44:11  c35f3f6773 "“Whom shall I announce?”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:46:30  2a65bf24a9 "The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlóvski, who was"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:48:33  c0deace001 "rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him."
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:51:02  a40868b37b "“The commander in chief is engaged,” repeated Kozlóvski calmly."
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:52:09  c6c0e772ea "The general’s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:53:58  8b8d4369cd "out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:55:22  2d7added92 "leaf, gave it to Kozlóvski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:56:17  d3c705e2ad "himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, “Why"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:57:07  5d391b4736 "do they look at me?” Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as"
 09/20/1812 Sun 01:59:34  ccad1a9192 "if he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:01:51  2d8c6b88db "indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:03:40  0ecd776a5f "immediately broke off. The door of the private room opened and Kutúzov"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:06:05  751d25de13 "appeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged head bent forward"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:08:27  7e92ec02fb "as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:08:59  f49b1af10b "with his thin legs, went up to Kutúzov."
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:09:45  dc97bb0d8d "“Vous voyez le malheureux Mack,” he uttered in a broken voice."
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:10:56  4972e785fe "Kutúzov’s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:11:45  c0deace001 "immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:12:50  e1f187cd3b "and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:14:28  c0deace001 "closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:16:09  8e6eb86adf "the door himself behind him."
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:16:59  ab0578b5be "The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:19:05  3cb288dc0d "and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct."
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:21:19  78af4e93f9 "Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:23:37  9ca9b461ae "orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:24:25  4dcde09871 "inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy."
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:26:39  0b1bd5a2df "Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:27:23  f61a4dc10c "lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:28:46  16b259b605 "details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:30:42  67ad74fafb "understood all the difficulties of the Russian army’s position, and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:32:51  05a9e06d05 "vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:34:48  e384dcd69b "play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:36:43  26a709ae86 "humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week’s time he might,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:37:22  72a7ab73d9 "perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:38:31  03e76c8a42 "French since Suvórov met them. He feared that Bonaparte’s genius"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:39:13  24114daeff "might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same"
 09/20/1812 Sun 02:40:17  33e5aa3f9a "time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced."

 09/20/1812 Sun 06:38:44  8def618440 "cough."
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:40:02  1c8df2e904 "“The squadron quartermaster!” said Lavrúshka."
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:41:55  655bc14d28 "Denísov’s face puckered still more."
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:43:55  1666f1a607 "“Wetched!” he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it."
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:44:32  1ef29e2fc1 "“Wostóv, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:45:32  d0f0f39f3e "purse undah the pillow,” he said, and went out to the quartermaster."
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:47:47  c0deace001 "Rostóv took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins"
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:49:31  617a8ca0f3 "in separate piles, began counting them."
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:51:44  0bccb330e8 "“Ah! Telyánin! How d’ye do? They plucked me last night,” came"
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:54:05  9f9830af6a "Denísov’s voice from the next room."
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:56:04  07c2eb9993 "“Where? At Bykov’s, at the rat’s... I knew it,” replied a piping"
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:57:48  0cd3b6fd24 "voice, and Lieutenant Telyánin, a small officer of the same squadron,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 06:59:34  3af22248b2 "entered the room."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:01:13  c2d2f5528e "Rostóv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:02:40  0c3aff5f6f "which was offered him. Telyánin for some reason had been transferred"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:05:08  b6b3930c45 "from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:06:00  1f4d74d4b7 "regiment but was not liked; Rostóv especially detested him and was"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:06:50  26c8f758fb "unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:09:08  37896caafb "“Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?” he asked. (Rook"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:10:02  69b632e704 "was a young horse Telyánin had sold to Rostóv.)"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:12:21  a3cf46d076 "The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:13:52  3b5a5a2316 "face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:15:15  c0deace001 "“I saw you riding this morning...” he added."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:16:44  acf299a63a "“Oh, he’s all right, a good horse,” answered Rostóv, though the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:17:38  7943be4af9 "horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:19:08  e96c40a2b2 "that sum. “He’s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,” he"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:20:18  fb988e393b "added."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:21:38  cfdb5328ea "“The hoof’s cracked! That’s nothing. I’ll teach you what to do"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:23:10  1de41b76c1 "and show you what kind of rivet to use.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:25:38  1cbd6ea9af "“Yes, please do,” said Rostóv."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:27:38  0a030c1a4b "“I’ll show you, I’ll show you! It’s not a secret. And it’s a"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:28:33  3a98de3849 "horse you’ll thank me for.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:30:23  f2fe3544c7 "“Then I’ll have it brought round,” said Rostóv wishing to avoid"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:32:23  6259d9497c "Telyánin, and he went out to give the order."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:33:40  34b2c0c320 "In the passage Denísov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:35:15  e71d39592d "facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing Rostóv,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:36:13  f206f95370 "Denísov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:36:45  27a2d8696d "thumb to the room where Telyánin was sitting, he frowned and gave a"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:37:55  c27da7cc01 "shudder of disgust."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:38:36  372b3f200e "“Ugh! I don’t like that fellow,” he said, regardless of the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:40:29  c9d33da7be "quartermaster’s presence."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:42:54  4eef965c40 "Rostóv shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: “Nor do I, but"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:44:43  c0deace001 "what’s one to do?” and, having given his order, he returned to"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:45:57  fb120a140b "Telyánin."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:47:44  f2990c6f46 "Telyánin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostóv had"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:49:00  834a465ee3 "left him, rubbing his small white hands."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:50:26  d487e70398 "“Well there certainly are disgusting people,” thought Rostóv as he"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:52:01  8fb59383c5 "entered."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:53:42  c7095f63b0 "“Have you told them to bring the horse?” asked Telyánin, getting up"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:54:58  39a3086b2e "and looking carelessly about him."
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:57:26  683aa5a792 "“I have.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 07:59:52  3d7e8e7e4a "“Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denísov about"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:00:57  f024d3cdff "yesterday’s order. Have you got it, Denísov?”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:02:16  61ddf15b0b "“Not yet. But where are you off to?”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:02:58  c033b32ffd "“I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,” said"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:04:55  2c48021899 "Telyánin."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:06:54  6644d95952 "They went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:08:26  83e6e0c026 "explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:09:25  4eef2e3d22 "When Rostóv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:11:14  cf625ccfe1 "table. Denísov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:12:16  86842f4ee4 "paper. He looked gloomily in Rostóv’s face and said: “I am witing"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:13:33  f64aa15a4e "to her.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:14:42  4852bab444 "He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:15:14  5a47e37570 "evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:17:10  333f41226f "write, told Rostóv the contents of his letter."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:19:17  785ee66546 "“You see, my fwiend,” he said, “we sleep when we don’t love. We"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:20:09  cb378b388f "are childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:21:59  a24bdfcceb "is pua’ as on the fihst day of cweation... Who’s that now? Send him"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:22:38  6736d12317 "to the devil, I’m busy!” he shouted to Lavrúshka, who went up to"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:23:42  76e32900ee "him not in the least abashed."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:24:55  ff345f1742 "“Who should it be? You yourself told him to come. It’s the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:25:29  6f1f2e08a9 "quartermaster for the money.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:27:52  ed8e902c29 "Denísov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:29:30  6ea505cd61 "“Wetched business,” he muttered to himself. “How much is left in"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:30:41  8aaa1b46e1 "the puhse?” he asked, turning to Rostóv."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:32:22  a4e8203b44 "“Seven new and three old imperials.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:34:46  445eed1b11 "“Oh, it’s wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:36:53  9eb796fb7d "sca’cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,” he shouted to Lavrúshka."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:37:31  d2cd9877a8 "“Please, Denísov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:39:06  ad13873308 "said Rostóv, blushing."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:39:59  822603fe8a "“Don’t like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don’t,” growled"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:42:28  58005722d1 "Denísov."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:43:51  188e49b0c3 "“But if you won’t accept money from me like a comrade, you will"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:45:11  8144ed3816 "offend me. Really I have some,” Rostóv repeated."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:46:29  264bbd3893 "“No, I tell you.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:48:04  6b4f723a82 "And Denísov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:48:51  568847587f "“Where have you put it, Wostóv?”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:49:31  5e5d3c8bea "“Under the lower pillow.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:50:08  b6d1b9ac98 "“It’s not there.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:51:17  675f2c34e1 "Denísov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:53:08  9e3df75f77 "“That’s a miwacle.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:54:10  48b9a42871 "“Wait, haven’t you dropped it?” said Rostóv, picking up the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:56:06  c0deace001 "pillows one at a time and shaking them."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:57:10  4e752e9df7 "He pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there."
 09/20/1812 Sun 08:58:24  912c1ae2cd "“Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:00:24  a83843e7d0 "it under your head like a treasure,” said Rostóv. “I put it just"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:01:43  a2dc9ea6a9 "here. Where is it?” he asked, turning to Lavrúshka."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:02:18  22165bdb0d "“I haven’t been in the room. It must be where you put it.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:04:27  3dde4c571b "“But it isn’t?...”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:06:20  d2ba025fe9 "“You’re always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:07:38  18263176bb "it. Feel in your pockets.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:09:44  dd98618556 "“No, if I hadn’t thought of it being a treasure,” said Rostóv,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:11:22  a21fc871be "“but I remember putting it there.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:13:40  e367e7b28f "Lavrúshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:14:27  c6fa2e8f3a "the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:15:08  a14c62744e "room. Denísov silently watched Lavrúshka’s movements, and when the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:17:21  f619bd2944 "latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:19:45  7218511bb0 "Denísov glanced at Rostóv."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:20:35  de076cff13 "“Wostóv, you’ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:21:45  dce0331a8d "Rostóv felt Denísov’s gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:22:25  4afee98231 "instantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:23:06  b8b26f0d32 "somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:25:10  7333393536 "draw breath."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:26:32  c6945cf845 "“And there hasn’t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:28:01  fc6b57c159 "yourselves. It must be here somewhere,” said Lavrúshka."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:29:02  48112967c5 "“Now then, you devil’s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:30:42  3c438712df "shouted Denísov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:32:13  c0deace001 "a threatening gesture. “If the purse isn’t found I’ll flog you,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:34:24  39fc26614e "I’ll flog you all.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:35:17  3333540845 "Rostóv, his eyes avoiding Denísov, began buttoning his coat, buckled"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:36:50  ba46aa0d2d "on his saber, and put on his cap."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:38:19  31f3bdcf0f "“I must have that purse, I tell you,” shouted Denísov, shaking his"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:39:13  0dcb332be2 "orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:41:12  bb40f768fa "“Denísov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,” said Rostóv,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:43:25  3ad8cc338f "going toward the door without raising his eyes. Denísov paused, thought"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:45:41  8385251d75 "a moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostóv hinted at, seized"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:46:29  a18e0cae16 "his arm."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:48:47  7b37b5182d "“Nonsense!” he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:50:34  1d7d9adf33 "out like cords. “You are mad, I tell you. I won’t allow it."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:52:37  bad958c90b "The purse is here! I’ll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:53:36  dcf027091c "found.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:54:59  59284edd83 "“I know who has taken it,” repeated Rostóv in an unsteady voice,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:56:11  856f510334 "and went to the door."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:56:58  6c299e155c "“And I tell you, don’t you dahe to do it!” shouted Denísov,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:58:30  27ac1acd27 "rushing at the cadet to restrain him."
 09/20/1812 Sun 09:59:53  ebe9c77720 "But Rostóv pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:02:15  30e45bc624 "Denísov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:03:34  8a51e551df "face."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:05:09  c0deace001 "“Do you understand what you’re saying?” he said in a trembling"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:06:30  c0deace001 "voice. “There was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:08:51  b70888ccb6 "is not so, then...”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:11:04  de113d9a81 "He could not finish, and ran out of the room."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:11:42  e273ba3856 "“Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody,” were the last words"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:12:34  f4291b510b "Rostóv heard."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:13:49  5690f94408 "Rostóv went to Telyánin’s quarters."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:15:28  9511622cde "“The master is not in, he’s gone to headquarters,” said"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:16:51  584a323f12 "Telyánin’s orderly. “Has something happened?” he added, surprised"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:17:47  6addb5ac66 "at the cadet’s troubled face."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:19:49  155cf4ce9c "“No, nothing.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:22:07  0a8e72ac4c "“You’ve only just missed him,” said the orderly."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:24:02  aed1408bc7 "The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:26:20  5a1da7fc7f "Rostóv, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:28:08  945c45462e "an inn in the village which the officers frequented. Rostóv rode up to"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:29:39  1c79b0fda3 "it and saw Telyánin’s horse at the porch."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:31:43  362a224572 "In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:33:41  22287a8d54 "sausages and a bottle of wine."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:35:00  c0deace001 "“Ah, you’ve come here too, young man!” he said, smiling and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:36:32  d2ec7e2a6c "raising his eyebrows."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:38:12  ac1fd75000 "“Yes,” said Rostóv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:40:19  1fbcefd58b "word; and he sat down at the nearest table."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:42:33  b6384a46f4 "Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:44:23  7be75efb0a "room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives"
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:45:33  0b1512c311 "and the munching of the lieutenant."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:46:32  e27a4bbd66 "When Telyánin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double"

 09/20/1812 Sun 10:54:51  14fbd89a78 "The coin was a new one. Rostóv rose and went up to Telyánin."
 09/20/1812 Sun 10:56:04  08593b4c93 "“Allow me to look at your purse,” he said in a low, almost"

 09/20/1812 Sun 11:00:19  517d2e89d8 "With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyánin handed him the"

 09/20/1812 Sun 11:03:45  84d5b53ca2 "“Yes, it’s a nice purse. Yes, yes,” he said, growing suddenly"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:04:48  a022ec46dc "pale, and added, “Look at it, young man.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:05:19  028551a1c4 "Rostóv took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:06:17  c25a8ecb86 "looked at Telyánin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:07:46  ac96a8925f "and suddenly seemed to grow very merry."
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:09:49  68afc9cf9b "“If we get to Vienna I’ll get rid of it there but in these wretched"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:10:28  95cd663a03 "little towns there’s nowhere to spend it,” said he. “Well, let me"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:11:15  8513424d68 "have it, young man, I’m going.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:12:59  0cf7082ddc "Rostóv did not speak."

 09/20/1812 Sun 11:16:44  71fbe62587 "decently here,” continued Telyánin. “Now then, let me have it.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:18:02  9dc31a511c "He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostóv let go of"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:19:27  dcd8c8575d "it. Telyánin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:21:56  91441210dc "pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:23:58  3606fd87e9 "slightly open, as if to say, “Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:26:25  125736bf18 "pocket and that’s quite simple and is no one else’s business.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:27:57  a206d854fb "“Well, young man?” he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:29:29  026eae37e1 "brows he glanced into Rostóv’s eyes."
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:31:32  04c444c0fb "Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyánin’s eyes to"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:32:24  55de66901b "Rostóv’s and back, and back again and again in an instant."
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:34:28  284f8f9474 "“Come here,” said Rostóv, catching hold of Telyánin’s arm and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:35:01  c0deace001 "almost dragging him to the window. “That money is Denísov’s; you"

 09/20/1812 Sun 11:38:26  6593dc749c "“What? What? How dare you? What?” said Telyánin."
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:39:52  1d366a697b "But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:41:29  334ef4debf "pardon. As soon as Rostóv heard them, an enormous load of doubt"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:42:04  a7b30f0349 "fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:42:42  f2dceaaca9 "miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:44:06  f01f4140c0 "completed."

 09/20/1812 Sun 11:51:03  58e1976a42 "“I know it and shall prove it,” said Rostóv."

 09/20/1812 Sun 11:52:26  773c18fcca "Every muscle of Telyánin’s pale, terrified face began to quiver, his"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:53:11  5d2cfff8b9 "eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:53:54  cecd290481 "to Rostóv’s face, and his sobs were audible."
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:54:52  2f4f3b27cc "“Count!... Don’t ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 11:56:51  23133a2515 "take it...” He threw it on the table. “I have an old father and"

 09/20/1812 Sun 12:01:09  a342962c6a "Rostóv took the money, avoiding Telyánin’s eyes, and went out of the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:01:49  517317d7c6 "room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:02:46  ffa896554a "steps. “O God,” he said with tears in his eyes, “how could you do"

 09/20/1812 Sun 12:13:58  431ce4b5ed "“And I tell you, Rostóv, that you must apologize to the colonel!”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:16:05  c0deace001 "said a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:17:32  074c8030b2 "many wrinkles on his large features, to Rostóv who was crimson with"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:19:09  25f7bd1009 "excitement."
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:20:39  a60431b82e "The staff captain, Kírsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:23:05  15f5129d86 "affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission."
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:24:48  9eb9c95dbe "“I will allow no one to call me a liar!” cried Rostóv. “He told"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:26:18  c0deace001 "me I lied, and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:26:50  8e8e881626 "on duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:28:04  aab5b0aa06 "me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:28:36  36b5cdec26 "beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:29:58  b8799a9e41 "“You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,” interrupted"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:31:16  9bee04272c "the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache."

 09/20/1812 Sun 12:35:07  180217d304 "“I’m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:36:18  e6644c055e "other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:37:25  db5cab3dac "not a diplomatist. That’s why I joined the hussars, thinking that here"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:38:28  0f78281886 "one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying—so let him"

 09/20/1812 Sun 12:44:15  8d449ad9da "demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:45:06  b48d8f0b7f "Denísov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:46:45  c6b1fd7086 "conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 12:47:27  ef8b9c8f1a "staff captain’s question by a disapproving shake of his head."

 09/20/1812 Sun 12:58:27  a4eb05b084 "“Not on any account!” exclaimed Rostóv."
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:00:51  4a74e6ea04 "“I did not expect this of you,” said the staff captain seriously and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:02:59  1c1bd19e50 "severely. “You don’t wish to apologize, but, man, it’s not only to"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:04:03  230c76b1d2 "him but to the whole regiment—all of us—you’re to blame all round."
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:05:19  463530835c "The case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:06:10  068d920faa "taken advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:07:08  a36c2166eb "officers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:09:08  eff3c2b7bb "disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:10:02  2146032a00 "scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don’t see it like that. And"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:11:52  40f54e629f "Bogdánich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true."
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:12:32  a407546378 "It’s not pleasant, but what’s to be done, my dear fellow? You landed"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:13:39  8179d6b41e "yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:14:28  61dc751300 "conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:16:01  a43ab9f833 "affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:17:42  1e4e68a58b "apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogdánich may"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:19:00  c0deace001 "be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! You’re quick at"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:20:52  83404bd894 "taking offense, but you don’t mind disgracing the whole regiment!”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 13:22:49  913598f2ef "The staff captain’s voice began to tremble. “You have been in the"

 09/20/1812 Sun 23:05:25  9448424f2f "he sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:07:43  abf4902322 "indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth."
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:10:02  c5f8c88d9b "“Who’s that curtseying there? Cadet Miwónov! That’s not wight!"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:12:01  5490a3a0a0 "Look at me,” cried Denísov who, unable to keep still on one spot,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:14:25  8caee8281b "kept turning his horse in front of the squadron."
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:16:36  d43ab9e392 "The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Váska Denísov, and his whole"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:18:56  643b1f3b84 "short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:20:37  c0deace001 "which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:22:07  9d3d26b3e8 "did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:23:08  73c775bf3c "was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:24:24  47a547c349 "when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:25:47  05e639614b "good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:26:54  f62fae423c "saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:27:55  39f0586a99 "a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:28:48  94cd9e9d4e "Kírsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:30:46  79e9fe8213 "walk to meet him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:33:08  9ed5816733 "only his eyes were brighter than usual."
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:34:52  22233d2f2e "“Well, what about it?” said he to Denísov. “It won’t come to a"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:36:21  e7b2329ed4 "fight. You’ll see—we shall retire.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:38:12  b3151e8cab "“The devil only knows what they’re about!” muttered Denísov."
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:40:23  0309286b22 "“Ah, Wostóv,” he cried noticing the cadet’s bright face,"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:41:29  c0deace001 "“you’ve got it at last.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:43:03  29a7a486ec "And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. Rostóv"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:44:08  7ef657b258 "felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge."
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:46:04  3e8eb4bdd7 "Denísov galloped up to him."
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:46:41  78444949c8 "“Your excellency! Let us attack them! I’ll dwive them off.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:49:10  66a9a6ccc5 "“Attack indeed!” said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:51:14  2b5beca65c "face as if driving off a troublesome fly. “And why are you stopping"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:52:01  5e5619433a "here? Don’t you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:54:27  6c4a18daf6 "back.”"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:56:20  bd69d4c716 "The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without"
 09/20/1812 Sun 23:58:49  580141a73e "having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:00:36  7e0f0125e2 "line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:02:15  c0deace001 "of the river."
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:03:52  a334ded4e8 "The two Pávlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:04:34  c0deace001 "hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdánich Schubert, came"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:05:04  2d9043d7c7 "up to Denísov’s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostóv,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:06:17  74f24b5cea "without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:07:17  d3adc359df "first time since their encounter concerning Telyánin. Rostóv, feeling"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:08:40  791ebb344a "that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:10:22  e2ebf6cfba "admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:11:45  988e38f7f1 "colonel’s athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:13:32  6dcd22eb2e "neck. It seemed to Rostóv that Bogdánich was only pretending not"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:14:42  8bea2ac74e "to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet’s"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:15:49  ef3bb684df "courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:16:50  c0deace001 "seemed to him that Bogdánich rode so near in order to show him his"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:19:18  ce7126237e "courage. Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:19:52  4f66b3b1b3 "desperate attack just to punish him—Rostóv. Then he imagined how,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:20:29  8fe8184fe0 "after the attack, Bogdánich would come up to him as he lay wounded and"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:22:11  df2980cfa8 "would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation."
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:23:41  55fddb044e "The high-shouldered figure of Zherkóv, familiar to the Pávlograds as"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:24:46  bbd8ee881f "he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel."
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:25:54  127d21ea6e "After his dismissal from headquarters Zherkóv had not remained in the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:27:23  5d31b082d7 "regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:28:27  5462435a59 "could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:29:10  d5eb14c38e "in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagratión. He now"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:30:57  96860f68ec "came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:31:49  83fcbbb17a "guard."
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:33:47  724dfdf889 "“Colonel,” he said, addressing Rostóv’s enemy with an air of"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:35:25  5909297246 "gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, “there is an order"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:37:35  d6d36c54fb "to stop and fire the bridge.”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:38:42  08630d4803 "“An order to who?” asked the colonel morosely."
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:39:52  74833a3c1c "“I don’t myself know ‘to who,’” replied the cornet in a"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:41:01  9762abaaa5 "serious tone, “but the prince told me to ‘go and tell the colonel"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:42:20  83a83ca38b "that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.’”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:43:14  062022b458 "Zherkóv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:44:23  7844105fc7 "colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout Nesvítski"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:46:17  77a794aefc "came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:47:33  f3cb19580c "weight."
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:49:36  435b41bf49 "“How’s this, Colonel?” he shouted as he approached. “I told you"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:50:34  04318c7654 "to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:52:36  9494758747 "beside themselves over there and one can’t make anything out.”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:53:56  6801f3d8a0 "The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvítski."
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:55:26  41491a1a37 "“You spoke to me of inflammable material,” said he, “but you said"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:56:05  a64f1d458b "nothing about firing it.”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:57:56  fd290c19b1 "“But, my dear sir,” said Nesvítski as he drew up, taking off his"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:58:50  048b9190c8 "cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 00:59:28  c0deace001 "“wasn’t I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:00:21  7009e63762 "had been put in position?”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:02:11  6120d385ef "“I am not your ‘dear sir,’ Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:02:59  4c4a2d5ffb "me to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:04:27  f1156fe7e7 "strictly to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would it"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:06:47  af97c16422 "burn, I could not know by the holy spirit!”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:08:34  6847fc98de "“Ah, that’s always the way!” said Nesvítski with a wave of the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:10:29  9a9b01b3cf "hand. “How did you get here?” said he, turning to Zherkóv."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:11:02  b828b42649 "“On the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring you out!”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:11:58  ffc6c2e9ae "“You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...” continued the colonel in an"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:14:15  c0deace001 "offended tone."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:16:11  c0a78a542f "“Colonel,” interrupted the officer of the suite, “You must be"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:18:00  f5166fa779 "quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:18:30  4ca4d0681d "The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:19:06  f83152ea15 "staff officer, and at Zherkóv, and he frowned."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:21:35  ebac290274 "“I will the bridge fire,” he said in a solemn tone as if to announce"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:22:46  7a420d17e3 "that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:23:38  08867c17d1 "do the right thing."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:24:46  acd4569e53 "Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:27:13  e0bd64fe0a "for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:28:44  1d3cb98852 "squadron, that in which Rostóv was serving under Denísov, to return to"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:29:25  dfc8632500 "the bridge."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:30:20  21c348efad "“There, it’s just as I thought,” said Rostóv to himself. “He"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:31:23  4f594d6fc2 "wishes to test me!” His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:32:46  9ecd1a0aad "face. “Let him see whether I am a coward!” he thought."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:34:42  af85e3a74b "Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:35:54  b59277ad3d "appeared that they had worn when under fire. Rostóv watched his enemy,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:36:30  6d37b390d0 "the colonel, closely—to find in his face confirmation of his own"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:38:42  4cac8183ca "conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostóv, and looked"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:39:54  34f6c71477 "as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:41:48  a14e7aa8af "of command."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:42:23  5dabfff036 "“Look sharp! Look sharp!” several voices repeated around him."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:44:47  def7755cdb "Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:46:51  98423afd7b "hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:48:25  c8c308c6a8 "were crossing themselves. Rostóv no longer looked at the colonel, he"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:50:40  8adb6436ef "had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:52:01  6143bd5732 "that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:53:00  7a1b035b3b "an orderly’s charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:55:10  f3cab52932 "a thud. Denísov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:56:50  2aeb87664d "Rostóv saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs"
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:57:28  0eb8ca2f4b "catching and their sabers clattering."
 09/21/1812 Mon 01:59:02  d4dc694306 "“Stretchers!” shouted someone behind him."
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:00:08  21f6ff91cf "Rostóv did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:02:06  c0deace001 "trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:03:11  95dfad2b0e "looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:05:00  c2599e33a9 "and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him."
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:07:08  1a82512652 "“At boss zides, Captain,” he heard the voice of the colonel, who,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:08:35  7d5fa7b02b "having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:11:02  f01f4d735d "triumphant, cheerful face."
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:13:07  c31593244e "Rostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:15:27  77f2d6c1bd "was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:15:58  653f72c229 "the better. But Bogdánich, without looking at or recognizing Rostóv,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:16:29  5d3fb13175 "shouted to him:"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:17:22  a9eb38a6b4 "“Who’s that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:18:38  faa59c97ac "back, Cadet!” he cried angrily; and turning to Denísov, who, showing"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:20:27  3f73c97166 "off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:21:55  2de19ab9a3 "“Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount,” he said."
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:23:18  d102dbf27f "“Oh, every bullet has its billet,” answered Váska Denísov, turning"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:24:41  c0deace001 "in his saddle."
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:25:20  dc1444d9e9 "Meanwhile Nesvítski, Zherkóv, and the officer of the suite were"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:26:48  57e4f74658 "standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:28:45  d8b777a618 "group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:30:58  eff0652a74 "and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:31:30  d1161f6e5d "what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side—the blue"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:33:12  b4df83ec96 "uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery."
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:34:08  59a0f75b51 "“Will they burn the bridge or not? Who’ll get there first? Will they"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:35:01  3df586853c "get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:36:15  40dd6b9623 "range and wipe them out?” These were the questions each man of the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:38:21  3fb7637712 "troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:39:15  c389e754b8 "with a sinking heart—watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:41:33  582c7d021c "evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:42:08  b5f6f1fd39 "their bayonets and guns."
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:44:30  c0deace001 "“Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!” said Nesvítski; “they are"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:45:40  4591468660 "within grapeshot range now.”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:47:13  d4035b825a "“He shouldn’t have taken so many men,” said the officer of the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:48:06  5678e99f4a "suite."
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:50:05  c0deace001 "“True enough,” answered Nesvítski; “two smart fellows could have"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:52:33  261231a266 "done the job just as well.”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:54:23  7be1fbcbd4 "“Ah, your excellency,” put in Zherkóv, his eyes fixed on the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:55:46  eac253e86b "hussars, but still with that naïve air that made it impossible to know"
 09/21/1812 Mon 02:58:07  a27e8af2a2 "whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. “Ah, your excellency!"
 09/21/1812 Mon 03:00:20  54e00b8c2c "How you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the"

 09/21/1812 Mon 09:53:15  9a229312ab "important post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador"
 09/21/1812 Mon 09:55:11  a51e1f15ba "in Vienna knew him and valued him. He was not one of those many"

 09/21/1812 Mon 10:00:47  d4776340c0 "sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked well"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:02:06  10457faf15 "whatever the import of his work. It was not the question “What for?”"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:03:05  8843d27f2e "but the question “How?” that interested him. What the diplomatic"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:04:55  2dbc88cc07 "matter might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:06:03  a063578cad "prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:06:46  153f751599 "elegantly. Bilíbin’s services were valued not only for what he wrote,"

 09/21/1812 Mon 10:11:38  e12e05a22c "made elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:12:17  42682ff5ab "something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:12:57  22d406e1bc "possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:14:41  2eec4a5676 "finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:16:46  752743c113 "inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:17:47  29f1c3f982 "that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:20:15  22e1ccd571 "drawing room. And, in fact, Bilíbin’s witticisms were hawked about"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:21:19  5a5b6ed1ed "in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters"

 09/21/1812 Mon 10:26:55  a9f5b94182 "Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:29:23  bca0e5eab2 "of expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:30:56  80d13282cc "and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and"
 09/21/1812 Mon 10:31:50  388036f78e "deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always"

 09/21/1812 Mon 23:55:36  8f5c08ce97 "up to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by"

 09/21/1812 Mon 23:59:14  0244cf4c88 "He turned round. Nesvítski’s handsome face looked out of the little"

 09/22/1812 Tue 00:05:47  7c8d9e509c "Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvítski and another adjutant"
 09/22/1812 Tue 00:07:25  cdab118fdf "having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he"
 09/22/1812 Tue 00:09:20  3f21f197c5 "had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm."
 09/22/1812 Tue 00:11:23  2193ddc20b "This was particularly noticeable on Nesvítski’s usually laughing"

 09/22/1812 Tue 01:01:25  3a98c76714 "house with Prince Bagratión and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:03:25  fa0bc5983a "general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozlóvski was"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:05:03  f4ddb54304 "squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:06:03  b3d5316438 "up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozlóvski’s"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:07:30  89bf7ffb0d "face looked worn—he too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced"

 09/22/1812 Tue 01:18:18  0a0590cad1 "sound of these voices, the inattentive way Kozlóvski looked at him, the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:20:20  1968064dbb "disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and"

 09/22/1812 Tue 01:26:41  73fbcfb978 "disastrous was about to happen."
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:28:08  c0deace001 "He turned to Kozlóvski with urgent questions."

 09/22/1812 Tue 01:40:29  36e994a2dd "Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutúzov but the expression of"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:42:37  e37da31db5 "the commander in chief’s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:43:51  84ec19c78f "with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:45:48  93f6d4941b "looked straight at his adjutant’s face without recognizing him."
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:47:04  815521fc76 "“Well, have you finished?” said he to Kozlóvski."
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:48:41  7e1bf623df "“One moment, your excellency.”"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:49:28  9a72d6823f "Bagratión, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:50:40  7f99253cc9 "impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief."
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:51:41  dc4d30e8bf "“I have the honor to present myself,” repeated Prince Andrew rather"
 09/22/1812 Tue 01:52:21  5e8cacaed7 "loudly, handing Kutúzov an envelope."

 09/22/1812 Tue 01:55:25  5dc1d32436 "Kutúzov went out into the porch with Bagratión."

 09/22/1812 Tue 01:59:12  c64dda5ec2 "His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left"

 09/22/1812 Tue 02:01:49  f1eb9cf28e "a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently"
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:03:16  18552d1920 "habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagratión kissed him on the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:04:36  42563a8ee4 "neck instead."
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:05:31  c66599431d "“Christ be with you!” Kutúzov repeated and went toward his"

 09/22/1812 Tue 02:19:20  665a778afd "mind. “If a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,”"
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:21:14  cd2770d3aa "he added as if speaking to himself."
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:21:59  d56f9c177f "Prince Andrew glanced at Kutúzov’s face only a foot distant from him"
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:22:58  191547f731 "and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near"
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:23:28  31110cef09 "his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty"
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:25:32  c61a5cf9b4 "eye socket. “Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men’s"

 09/22/1812 Tue 02:31:08  22c75db248 "Kutúzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been"
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:33:28  c0deace001 "saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying"
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:34:00  71572348de "on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew."
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:35:58  3e3fcdc154 "There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he"
 09/22/1812 Tue 02:38:17  3c55a10e01 "questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the"

 09/22/1812 Tue 09:32:33  8e1a5bd22c "campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was"
 09/22/1812 Tue 09:33:06  61c16ec1ba "trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all"

 09/22/1812 Tue 10:29:35  9cb921d305 "artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the"

 09/22/1812 Tue 10:33:12  80ceb49d86 "Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes"
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:35:09  8f5a94c902 "and artillerymen’s bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest"

 09/22/1812 Tue 10:38:05  792b8dd913 "It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the"

 09/22/1812 Tue 10:41:08  f0fb87ff3e "could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops"
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:42:34  25d9ca93f2 "amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were"
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:44:58  72747b6434 "evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left from"
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:47:20  f29afebc2b "that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it"
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:48:25  44262e6022 "was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was"
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:50:32  bd5a2ce3db "posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position."
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:52:58  85bf1f061c "Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:54:09  a4e10f19fc "dragoons. In the center, where Túshin’s battery stood and from which"
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:54:45  8cdf2079f6 "Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most"

 09/22/1812 Tue 10:58:02  a6dfe4f28f "Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked"
 09/22/1812 Tue 10:59:03  1b3a4f206d "the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:00:27  db216518a6 "wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:01:22  62ee56e99f "on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:02:50  c0deace001 "difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:03:48  933e86a453 "out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:06:08  d75b72fbab "position. He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:06:44  30454ba63c "Bagratión. His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:08:53  7a608d810a "center, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:10:46  5db68c18e8 "dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:12:59  75b0e45d14 "following the mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:14:42  9bc43d400d "historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:15:32  143e6dee63 "course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:17:12  5d1f97ace8 "imagined only important possibilities: “If the enemy attacks the right"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:18:56  169f97e7c8 "flank,” he said to himself, “the Kiev grenadiers and the Podólsk"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:20:52  4b9b813583 "chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:22:35  990cc56ccb "come up. In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:24:32  494e0271d1 "counterattack. If they attack our center we, having the center battery"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:25:14  4613e19147 "on this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:26:34  17f0b8d9f1 "retreat to the dip by echelons.” So he reasoned.... All the time"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:28:57  15c511c1ea "he had been beside the gun, he had heard the voices of the officers"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:30:36  68f7bd6bda "distinctly, but as often happens had not understood a word of what they"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:31:42  5776db7a6c "were saying. Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:33:49  c67da855d5 "shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen."
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:35:55  e6a89e7ba4 "“No, friend,” said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:36:38  c0deace001 "familiar voice, “what I say is that if it were possible to know"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:37:25  afc060f2ad "what is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. That’s so,"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:38:07  ab1dc805b8 "friend.”"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:38:50  deaf445bed "Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: “Afraid or not, you can’t"

 09/22/1812 Tue 11:42:12  f3444fe2f1 "“All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,” said a third"

 09/22/1812 Tue 11:46:15  7cbb933e8f "very wise, because you can take everything along with you—vodka and"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:48:18  5064864715 "snacks.”"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:50:08  4c42408334 "And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:51:03  49028dbda3 "laughed."
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:52:56  9088e513b2 "“Yes, one is afraid,” continued the first speaker, he of the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:54:52  275d51898d "familiar voice. “One is afraid of the unknown, that’s what it is."
 09/22/1812 Tue 11:57:18  9521fad968 "Whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is"

 09/22/1812 Tue 12:03:53  5832f79e37 "in the sutler’s hut without his boots.” He recognized the agreeable,"
 09/22/1812 Tue 12:04:38  ffe8973194 "philosophizing voice with pleasure."
 09/22/1812 Tue 12:05:25  3847a74a1d "“Some herb vodka? Certainly!” said Túshin. “But still, to"

 09/22/1812 Tue 12:10:22  3ee751a00b "nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it"
 09/22/1812 Tue 12:10:59  1f446207a5 "had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near"
 09/22/1812 Tue 12:12:56  c0deace001 "the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground"
 09/22/1812 Tue 12:14:01  f98425fee8 "seemed to groan at the terrible impact."

 09/22/1812 Tue 14:29:49  8728fca167 "saber which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of"
 09/22/1812 Tue 14:31:01  f6b9e20d99 "a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of"

 09/22/1812 Tue 14:33:26  d9b62ed823 "was particularly pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery"

 09/22/1812 Tue 14:41:49  8d53e8db83 "“Yes, yes,” muttered Bagratión as if considering something, and he"
 09/22/1812 Tue 14:43:55  c0deace001 "rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon."
 09/22/1812 Tue 14:44:35  8e19dad247 "As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his"
 09/22/1812 Tue 14:45:31  424f687808 "suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see"

 09/22/1812 Tue 14:49:49  734bd0603d "former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding"
 09/22/1812 Tue 14:52:11  e080cd26ea "a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with"
 09/22/1812 Tue 14:53:30  d65c50232d "a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon’s mouth. The short,"

 09/22/1812 Tue 14:58:31  85315a66ed "shading his eyes with his small hand."
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:00:34  459ff179bb "“Lift it two lines more and it will be just right,” cried he in a"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:02:08  9401f3fe2b "feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:04:22  1ae52b397a "his weak figure. “Number Two!” he squeaked. “Fire, Medvédev!”"

 09/22/1812 Tue 15:08:59  c0deace001 "but like a priest’s benediction, approached the general. Though"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:10:36  a0ed44aac2 "Túshin’s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:12:47  c0deace001 "firing incendiary balls at the village of Schön Grabern visible just"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:13:37  37c378a8e1 "opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing."
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:15:53  47a3811a50 "No one had given Túshin orders where and at what to fire, but after"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:17:21  f39fbf8117 "consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchénko, for whom he had great"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:18:03  a20c298d4e "respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:20:16  1f2dbbed56 "village. “Very good!” said Bagratión in reply to the officer’s"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:20:56  f09d977333 "report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended"

 09/22/1812 Tue 15:29:31  285e536ab6 "heard, and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:30:42  185c3edf49 "the suite pointed out to Bagratión a French column that was outflanking"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:31:12  35bf464a2e "us. To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:33:36  4f09822da5 "Bagratión ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:34:24  42f0b5ff86 "reinforce the right flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:36:27  605526af19 "to the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:38:35  7828bb64ee "without support. Prince Bagratión turned to the officer and with his"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:40:12  4d6988e325 "dull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:40:48  4ccf062d12 "officer’s remark was just and that really no answer could be made to"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:42:09  48c50ecae5 "it. But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:43:16  d126066b3a "commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:45:25  2915f1aca7 "of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:47:42  26902106a5 "disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagratión"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:48:26  0ae96cc47a "bowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:49:11  524a9878ad "the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:51:27  70ec96fa6d "French. But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:52:35  6586660152 "the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:53:18  5f244576c3 "the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing"
 09/22/1812 Tue 15:54:33  c0deace001 "men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the"

 09/22/1812 Tue 16:01:47  c0deace001 "as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there"
 09/22/1812 Tue 16:03:57  fa205bb2a3 "himself, Prince Bagratión sent Zherkóv to tell the general in command"

 09/22/1812 Tue 16:08:58  912b0ad45b "as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy’s"

 09/22/1812 Tue 16:11:00  d5a616d8b9 "support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened"
