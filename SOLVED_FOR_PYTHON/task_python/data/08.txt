 10/17/1812 Sat 12:44:11  7ddfb74c7f "spoke. Kutúzov looked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the"

 10/18/1812 Sun 09:50:25  8c631e54a6 "can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our"
 10/18/1812 Sun 09:51:46  14d08da06a "entrenchments. There, you see? There’s our center, at Borodinó, just"
 10/18/1812 Sun 09:53:23  d5a284cfb8 "there,” and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white"

 10/18/1812 Sun 10:00:12  c0deace001 "explain.... Yesterday our left flank was there at Shevárdino, you see,"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:00:45  7339e43c61 "where the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wing—now it is over"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:02:03  ab5a0cf06a "there, do you see that village and the smoke? That’s Semënovsk, yes,"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:03:36  4ddcb7ee11 "there,” he pointed to Raévski’s knoll. “But the battle will hardly"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:04:11  629de9ff54 "be there. His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:06:29  6063dc03ad "probably pass round to the right of the Moskvá. But wherever it may be,"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:08:04  9421c9ad53 "many a man will be missing tomorrow!” he remarked."

 10/18/1812 Sun 10:14:15  654b6e1711 "at this point, evidently not liking the officer’s remark, interrupted"

 10/18/1812 Sun 10:20:08  e80127f983 "of it."

 10/18/1812 Sun 10:26:57  fd432b9cba "“No, I’ve come on my own,” answered Pierre, and he went down the hill"

 10/18/1812 Sun 10:47:52  a8f5bab486 "been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to meet the"

 10/18/1812 Sun 10:50:03  424e4f8755 "attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large,"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:52:32  4aed59c4ee "dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was the icon that had"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:54:24  a18718454b "been brought from Smolénsk and had since accompanied the army. Behind,"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:56:46  a9bc998bbc "before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked,"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:57:22  797d9c8aba "ran, and bowed to the ground."
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:57:55  c0deace001 "At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had"
 10/18/1812 Sun 10:58:55  277f0ea466 "been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:01:22  b4aa749c08 "others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:03:31  fa0fd6b8f6 "rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:04:30  8751d0abbd "the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon."
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:06:18  9d203b56d9 "The singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:07:54  ec9c936ac9 "of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon."
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:10:01  30c632e012 "Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:10:48  f474a2996e "reserved for them. A bald general with a St. George’s Cross on his neck"

 10/18/1812 Sun 11:16:44  c243fa1870 "he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:18:04  0e30dd8ec8 "patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial"

 10/18/1812 Sun 11:19:46  ef4a4c470a "while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:21:07  72429bb3df "recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:22:54  6599a28a2b "look at them—his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious"

 10/18/1812 Sun 11:26:17  7e2d3ae110 "all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:28:44  0defe0531c "singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:31:01  f245173699 "mechanically to sing: “Save from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of"

 10/18/1812 Sun 11:42:36  c0deace001 "that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back,"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:44:05  dedde0f63d "and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard."
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:46:16  9137e95d4d "The crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre."
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:47:41  b24d25880b "Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:48:48  82222ada3d "was made for him, was approaching the icon."
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:49:29  d5a539fd62 "It was Kutúzov, who had been riding round the position and on his way"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:50:51  f40d0b823e "back to Tatárinova had stopped where the service was being held. Pierre"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:51:38  507bb1c451 "recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which distinguished him"

 10/18/1812 Sun 11:55:44  6528a34da7 "eye he had lost, Kutúzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:56:34  4f98c9e583 "the crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an"

 10/18/1812 Sun 11:58:07  bdea4b5139 "bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind Kutúzov was Bennigsen and"
 10/18/1812 Sun 11:59:58  279047b609 "the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who attracted"

 10/18/1812 Sun 12:02:46  8aaf41b6cb "continued their prayers without looking at him."

 10/18/1812 Sun 12:07:28  c0deace001 "rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight. His"
 10/18/1812 Sun 12:08:48  d275180274 "white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as"

 10/19/1812 Mon 16:53:06  eea2efca2f "“One moment, one moment!” replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout"
 10/19/1812 Mon 16:54:49  bc1494d803 "colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and"
 10/19/1812 Mon 16:56:25  4936f6c510 "then addressed Pierre."
 10/19/1812 Mon 16:57:45  289e97f3fb "“Why have you come here, Count?” he asked with a smile. “Still"
 10/19/1812 Mon 16:59:12  6a8e115ff7 "inquisitive?”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:01:14  39fc223e6c "“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:03:36  fc6977b4f5 "But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:05:11  0e24c4f7ec "“Here it’s tolerable,” said he, “but with Bagratión on the left flank"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:07:06  e69e853039 "they’re getting it frightfully hot.”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:09:20  62e5a62665 "“Really?” said Pierre. “Where is that?”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:10:07  7da798be2c "“Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:12:25  6f83539baf "our battery it is still bearable,” said the adjutant. “Will you come?”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:14:23  c0deace001 "“Yes, I’ll come with you,” replied Pierre, looking round for his groom."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:15:06  494b9c0573 "It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:17:08  8227f29877 "carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:18:44  db2875f208 "before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:19:59  8f6881e796 "head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:20:57  9d52743dc8 "“Why haven’t they carried him away?” Pierre was about to ask, but seeing"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:22:55  d987aa37c8 "the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:23:55  35539003b9 "checked himself."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:26:22  74979b02d3 "Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:28:34  c0deace001 "adjutant to Raévski’s Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutant’s"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:29:42  adad1acd3c "and jolted him at every step."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:31:19  68da538861 "“You don’t seem to be used to riding, Count?” remarked the adjutant."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:33:02  6df16b5d17 "“No it’s not that, but her action seems so jerky,” said Pierre in a"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:34:54  2acf985afd "puzzled tone."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:36:34  c0deace001 "“Why... she’s wounded!” said the adjutant. “In the off foreleg above the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:37:11  b14a1b708c "knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:37:48  ec1343c568 "fire!”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:39:47  65105723b2 "Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:41:30  ab2a54175c "which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:42:49  869b2ce0da "noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:43:46  72ba0792c8 "with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:44:53  f5bca46152 "the hill on foot."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:46:04  f4bfa4fa78 "“Is the general here?” asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:47:58  b38f3cb723 "“He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,” someone told him,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:48:30  320b1cbb48 "pointing to the right."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:49:26  3dba374aec "The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now."
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:51:30  df57e23091 "“Don’t trouble about me,” said Pierre. “I’ll go up onto the knoll if I"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:53:51  d0872144c4 "may?”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:56:07  74e6968630 "“Yes, do. You’ll see everything from there and it’s less dangerous, and"
 10/19/1812 Mon 17:57:45  beae8ecd8f "I’ll come for you.”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:00:11  86044801b2 "Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:01:59  0d626788d7 "again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:02:36  d9c1434fe2 "day."
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:03:47  5f552bb6bb "The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:06:03  9f18be3851 "to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raévski’s Redoubt, and to the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:08:08  c0deace001 "French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:10:13  74040ab240 "around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:11:52  100956f82a "the key to the whole position."
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:14:14  f097754af0 "This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:14:57  6c7d351ef3 "been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:15:43  f1ed62a814 "through openings in the earthwork."
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:17:10  dfac410b9d "In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:19:07  93c6301024 "incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:21:03  af71c259f1 "that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:22:55  e6db7757df "had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:24:59  8d6fa72de6 "important point of the battle."
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:26:54  e42e4cdb56 "On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:28:15  08e1c3b8c0 "of the least significant parts of the field."
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:29:24  b3b655a896 "Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:30:08  65e93cb932 "surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:31:48  601c1a3d0e "an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:33:35  561f30480c "battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:35:01  d92d106b10 "who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:35:58  12c69e8122 "him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being fired"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:37:39  e4185f8418 "continually one after another with a deafening roar, enveloping the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:39:23  47b7a33999 "whole neighborhood in powder smoke."
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:39:54  d46c2f1e75 "In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:41:26  cf324d0413 "here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:42:56  2ec1de1d2a "separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:44:27  da66b08d79 "as it were family feeling of animation."
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:45:47  f289501afb "The intrusion of Pierre’s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:46:27  35a949007f "unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:48:05  46e3b99bde "surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior artillery"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:50:07  d06617d89b "officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:52:25  23701256b0 "to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity."
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:53:38  1fa0d43431 "A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:54:35  fa9b6c8fd5 "out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:56:28  1d5e2c8e59 "entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly."
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:58:50  d5bff80156 "“Sir,” he said, “permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be"
 10/19/1812 Mon 18:59:40  46b4a1db60 "here.”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:01:46  5b554d0016 "The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:02:16  7b147526d6 "But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:04:03  c0deace001 "was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:05:52  b8ff931703 "with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:06:53  9cd411735a "and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:07:53  0ac5cf2529 "their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:09:07  8a86d06ee0 "kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:11:00  5256d3ba5b "cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:12:31  9e119d7561 "regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:13:52  ffc3a4eb90 "gave him a nickname (“our gentleman”), and made kindly fun of him among"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:14:47  bff037225c "themselves."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:15:35  1c63e9be97 "A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:17:44  511721cdeb "with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:18:58  bc59887c8e "“And how’s it you’re not afraid, sir, really now?” a red-faced,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:20:50  dc41213863 "broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:22:13  57c98f031a "of sound, white teeth."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:23:28  005a3b61cc "“Are you afraid, then?” said Pierre."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:24:22  7711669a19 "“What else do you expect?” answered the soldier. “She has no mercy, you"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:26:37  91dc2ff278 "know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One can’t"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:28:54  d8a7a9fc2a "help being afraid,” he said laughing."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:30:39  215db958ed "Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:33:04  220b11caaa "They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:34:21  4b757e101a "discovery that he did so delighted them."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:35:30  c96913f403 "“It’s the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it’s wonderful!"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:37:43  5c6bef0d6f "There’s a gentleman for you!”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:39:36  034e082ffb "“To your places!” cried the young officer to the men gathered round"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:41:12  72aca25929 "Pierre."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:42:48  95a6b83a87 "The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:44:25  c0deace001 "second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:45:29  d8c9bb2d0a "great precision and formality."
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:46:59  602080c3f1 "The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:47:57  1fec1095a3 "intense over the whole field, especially to the left where Bagratión’s"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:50:04  fe0ac290ed "flèches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:50:53  1fdc9d6cd0 "almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:52:22  a4e90660af "attention was engrossed by watching the family circle—separated from all"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:52:59  d7f1df10bb "else—formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:54:24  bddf80d018 "joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:55:08  7a4a99c25f "was now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:56:47  c0263154fc "lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he"
 10/19/1812 Mon 19:58:55  c0a4e84bdd "observed the faces of those around him."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:00:05  a2c9572a3f "By ten o’clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:01:54  d4d75c06e7 "battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:03:41  0617d83638 "frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:05:35  8c3dc9a2fa "But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:06:46  ad0d59f6e3 "and jokes were heard on all sides."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:07:26  09e1858f71 "“A live one!” shouted a man as a whistling shell approached."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:07:58  768e8cbb03 "“Not this way! To the infantry!” added another with loud laughter,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:09:26  fcbff5d427 "seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:11:43  1bb90cab33 "“Are you bowing to a friend, eh?” remarked another, chaffing a peasant"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:13:54  c0deace001 "who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:16:06  19325a6236 "Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:17:04  5d6ee7fd38 "what was happening in front."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:18:18  5433b92bc0 "“They’ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,” said they, pointing"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:20:05  3d3c87625d "over the earthwork."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:22:18  6142087f64 "“Mind your own business,” an old sergeant shouted at them. “If they’ve"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:24:30  283c33d60f "retired it’s because there’s work for them to do farther back.”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:25:15  d16c56b232 "And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:26:36  44d907da23 "shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:27:59  5bd44de669 "“To the fifth gun, wheel it up!” came shouts from one side."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:29:18  581ff5f8c5 "“Now then, all together, like bargees!” rose the merry voices of those"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:31:39  79e75d1965 "who were moving the gun."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:33:30  7464c912c3 "“Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman’s hat off!” cried the red-faced"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:34:27  3ba138f377 "humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. “Awkward baggage!” he added"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:34:59  8f2f12595d "reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man’s"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:35:49  e0c210982a "leg."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:36:45  d096cd8930 "“Now then, you foxes!” said another, laughing at some militiamen who,"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:38:04  2472469b4c "stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:39:09  b0e7094dd8 "“So this gruel isn’t to your taste? Oh, you crows! You’re scared!” they"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:41:06  629b9d3088 "shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:42:04  e955bc6aa0 "had been torn off."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:43:41  2440ecffc9 "“There, lads... oh, oh!” they mimicked the peasants, “they don’t like it"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:44:50  4095a61f7f "at all!”"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:46:57  306f011bff "Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:47:58  d2063398b4 "every loss, the liveliness increased more and more."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:49:48  145af8043a "As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:51:58  af9264eee2 "rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:52:53  18d187d673 "what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:53:33  8587963429 "more intense glowed in the faces of these men."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:55:30  b766255c70 "Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:56:06  2e8b22e4c7 "what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:56:51  17bf58ec0d "which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the"
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:58:23  b7566c1eb8 "same way in his own soul."
 10/19/1812 Mon 20:59:20  2edea24445 "At ten o’clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of"

 10/20/1812 Tue 02:06:18  d27766186c "hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 02:07:43  4d2e26e4c2 "troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up"
 10/20/1812 Tue 02:08:51  32f7670f65 "on the farther side and wait. But before that order was given—almost"
 10/20/1812 Tue 02:09:53  cd9800c946 "as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodinó—the bridge had been"

 10/20/1812 Tue 02:31:46  b8bd2b2be0 "without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to"

 10/20/1812 Tue 03:00:06  9bc6e4ec37 "safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these men"
 10/20/1812 Tue 03:02:03  142628cd19 "who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood"

 10/20/1812 Tue 03:38:53  587d46cd59 "if His Majesty would let him have another division."
 10/20/1812 Tue 03:41:07  38bbb7af85 "“Reinforcements?” said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at"

 10/20/1812 Tue 04:01:42  497a440b1d "Napoleon, Berthier’s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who"
 10/20/1812 Tue 04:02:48  346dd3020a "was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard."

 10/20/1812 Tue 04:14:34  c0deace001 "“You are very fiery, Belliard,” said Napoleon, when he again came up to"

 10/20/1812 Tue 09:28:50  9a191c5ace "“You have seen? You have seen?...” Kutúzov shouted. Frowning and rising"

 10/20/1812 Tue 09:32:15  bb398cf32d "“How... how dare you!...” he shouted, choking and making a threatening"

 10/20/1812 Tue 09:35:04  fd0535bd26 "know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information"

 10/20/1812 Tue 10:00:07  77f6184973 "Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently"
 10/20/1812 Tue 10:02:22  aec5304c4a "aside, marveling at “the old gentleman’s” conceited stupidity."
 10/20/1812 Tue 10:04:51  36d328e726 "“Ah, here he is, my hero!” said Kutúzov to a portly, handsome,"

 10/20/1812 Tue 10:07:48  9b1520a34b "This was Raévski, who had spent the whole day at the most important part"

 10/20/1812 Tue 10:10:31  061aa5e215 "Raévski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and"

 10/20/1812 Tue 10:27:39  a340793d91 "Kutúzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to"

 10/20/1812 Tue 10:31:42  2faed1c702 "responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive."
 10/20/1812 Tue 10:34:00  9ca26b6ce1 "And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains"

 10/20/1812 Tue 10:45:58  52725fce38 "different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kutúzov had said,"
 10/20/1812 Tue 10:48:05  3b5a71619e "but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was"
 10/20/1812 Tue 10:49:04  8005cf0cbe "not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in"
 10/20/1812 Tue 10:50:29  99cb235836 "the commander in chief’s soul as in that of every Russian."
 10/20/1812 Tue 10:51:06  123a1886ae "And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing"

 10/20/1812 Tue 11:02:47  ad152df0cc "that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:03:46  ec4a7f92ff "enemy guns was directed between one and two o’clock."
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:06:14  1e25f78c44 "Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:08:05  11758950ca "lost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:10:24  67286457fb "right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious"

 10/20/1812 Tue 11:15:03  92b5a0101c "cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:15:46  c9bce73504 "if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:17:30  1e644aa341 "the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:19:30  82f72fd401 "were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:21:51  ead65aa93a "being dragged away and the wounded carried off."
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:23:15  706c8b93b4 "With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:24:43  46371c4e96 "yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred"

 10/20/1812 Tue 11:26:02  bec99a68c8 "mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:26:52  2fbd07adc8 "ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:27:29  2c9cd8e2f7 "shot and the cry of “stretchers!” was heard. Most of the time, by their"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:28:34  d326607715 "officers’ order, the men sat on the ground. One, having taken off his"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:30:51  82ffc44e23 "shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:33:05  f3a2098e52 "again; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:34:31  c0deace001 "his bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:36:44  c70d69a7d6 "bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:39:00  dba8d17105 "his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:40:06  5d23526242 "ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:42:20  488efd71cb "fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:43:24  5b444fc1b8 "rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:43:58  3f375ce110 "masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:44:50  503b7859ca "attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:45:51  8a6ec84c61 "some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:46:27  8f17436013 "were heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:48:08  6d44528723 "occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:49:30  362840cd01 "as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:50:04  83da1b1d39 "commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:51:06  be84493e0d "the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace."
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:52:17  ec89ab2c7e "“Hey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She’ll fall.... Ah,"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:54:32  33ee7e1a4f "they don’t see it!” came identical shouts from the ranks all along the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:55:16  6c6198391c "regiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:56:40  c9554b04a0 "dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner"
 10/20/1812 Tue 11:58:01  621f612c17 "in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:00:15  4f65c37ebb "close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:01:23  c0deace001 "aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:02:35  19b7353418 "such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:03:57  25b95765b5 "been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:06:10  32a04746b5 "and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier."
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:07:35  950946785f "Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:08:56  a927bf6741 "and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:09:36  cd4547b3e3 "meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back."
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:10:48  5197de4e30 "There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:11:54  a239539154 "went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:13:23  c0deace001 "carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:14:04  c968ce2516 "rear they returned immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew,"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:15:19  f36d162d2d "considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:17:33  56e24b73e1 "an example, walked about among the ranks, but he soon became convinced"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:19:58  1ba02fea40 "that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:21:47  e4347818fb "them. All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:23:57  f0051b4bf5 "unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:24:36  717640f1a6 "situation. He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:26:48  5c91c084df "grass, and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:29:04  bd4c655da9 "strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:30:55  e75a402ef0 "mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he must walk"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:31:59  4a93df64e9 "from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:34:11  c9c3e25f73 "from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:36:34  a7011bceb3 "palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:38:11  576eb34d43 "of the previous day’s thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:40:00  89af42867f "weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:40:38  e7a68127bb "of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:41:10  8817304990 "tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:41:42  ac985dad9f "waited. “Here it comes... this one is coming our way again!” he thought,"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:44:04  bd3c1f7142 "listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. “One,"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:45:06  eb8e7f5fa1 "another! Again! It has hit....” He stopped and looked at the ranks. “No,"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:47:16  1d125777d7 "it has gone over. But this one has hit!” And again he started trying"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:48:13  f61591f0b3 "to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:49:59  2626432550 "paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:51:52  7f6a9c96ae "chill ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:53:44  bbb2b1ca79 "had been hit—a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion."
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:54:22  5bead45793 "“Adjutant!” he shouted. “Order them not to crowd together.”"
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:56:17  aad9150e88 "The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew."
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:58:43  841adbebe0 "From the other side a battalion commander rode up."
 10/20/1812 Tue 12:59:49  953991f9a2 "“Look out!” came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:00:43  d9f0174576 "whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:02:17  c0deace001 "with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:03:48  0ac392b1e7 "battalion commander’s horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:04:58  2846db49bf "was right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:06:03  4215c26dda "major, and galloped aside. The horse’s terror infected the men."
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:06:54  24d80e231d "“Lie down!” cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground."
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:07:45  7f9b2a7dbe "Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:08:59  ff73bee261 "and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:09:32  91cf9729cf "the meadow."
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:12:01  2ef0dfa7c8 "“Can this be death?” thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new,"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:12:36  d616aa42a1 "envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:13:44  e757f86690 "that curled up from the rotating black ball. “I cannot, I do not wish to"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:15:48  4201cfd23e "die. I love life—I love this grass, this earth, this air....” He thought"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:18:09  c9345604aa "this, and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him."
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:20:16  c0deace001 "“It’s shameful, sir!” he said to the adjutant. “What...”"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:22:45  16f1d71324 "He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of"
 10/20/1812 Tue 13:24:46  5d34074147 "an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame,"

 10/20/1812 Tue 15:02:33  1212a4ca08 "he sighed and looked down."

 10/20/1812 Tue 15:34:51  0db7a5e248 "the uniform thrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and"

 10/20/1812 Tue 15:47:38  54ac963d71 "familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest"
 10/20/1812 Tue 15:48:10  f0341ef9c4 "to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all"

 10/20/1812 Tue 16:07:50  c0ed24bd3f "down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to"
