 10/30/1812 Fri 06:13:18  7bdf27da0c "back of their necks. In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:15:25  2be23d2949 "wagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:16:21  15511cc41d "been hitched on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:18:44  eaed361164 "splashed through the water that lay in the ruts."
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:19:25  751d0945e9 "Denísov’s horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped"

 10/30/1812 Fri 06:20:50  303a091e35 "“Oh, the devil!” exclaimed Denísov angrily, and showing his teeth he"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:22:22  b0574dbbc9 "struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:23:33  b1be3a793f "comrades with mud."
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:24:30  c0deace001 "Denísov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:25:43  5aa49f17f8 "(none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more because he"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:26:37  b6f31c9b79 "still had no news from Dólokhov and the man sent to capture a “tongue”"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:28:59  987547ceac "had not returned."

 10/30/1812 Fri 06:35:19  9426bb03ce "from under our noses,” thought Denísov, continually peering forward,"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:36:56  2c94b88f51 "hoping to see a messenger from Dólokhov."

 10/30/1812 Fri 06:49:54  110513289e "The approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:52:14  c70a5f7696 "visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:54:34  db3cc8ffac "gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:55:41  d2d68d3d32 "drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:56:11  7b914b4e8b "standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:58:31  c0deace001 "lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Denísov"
 10/30/1812 Fri 06:59:27  43639a498e "and handed him a sodden envelope."

 10/30/1812 Fri 07:03:16  eab5dc8a7a "Denísov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it."
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:03:54  9baa28d4d3 "“There, they kept telling us: ‘It’s dangerous, it’s dangerous,’”"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:05:43  669d2f51a6 "said the officer, addressing the esaul while Denísov was reading the"

 10/30/1812 Fri 07:08:10  c4528949dc "We have each of us two pistols.... But what’s this?” he asked, noticing"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:09:17  772b4c85b2 "the French drummer boy. “A prisoner? You’ve already been in action? May"

 10/30/1812 Fri 07:12:44  25ad45aab8 "“Wostóv! Pétya!” exclaimed Denísov, having run through the dispatch."
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:13:43  904c1238ce "“Why didn’t you say who you were?” and turning with a smile he held out"

 10/30/1812 Fri 07:16:48  c687b64f16 "The officer was Pétya Rostóv."
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:17:38  842607af17 "All the way Pétya had been preparing himself to behave with Denísov as"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:19:02  a15aba7e60 "befitted a grown-up man and an officer—without hinting at their previous"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:20:47  5d23eebcea "acquaintance. But as soon as Denísov smiled at him Pétya brightened"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:22:13  2157972511 "up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner he had been"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:24:02  8c6117a683 "rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already been in a battle"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:25:35  5d8e4532c7 "near Vyázma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there."
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:27:09  a26f4cbedc "“Well, I am glad to see you,” Denísov interrupted him, and his face"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:28:34  915e06b0e6 "again assumed its anxious expression."
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:29:35  eb6833d838 "“Michael Feoklítych,” said he to the esaul, “this is again fwom that"

 10/30/1812 Fri 07:42:45  c0deace001 "trousers—furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:44:22  3ddc09ced8 "that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air as"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:46:40  ac0611d258 "possible."
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:48:24  63e95bfab7 "“Will there be any orders, your honor?” he asked Denísov, holding his"

 10/30/1812 Fri 07:49:46  4b5b8c6328 "which he had prepared himself, “or shall I remain with your honor?”"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:51:59  8703f22c3f "“Orders?” Denísov repeated thoughtfully. “But can you stay till"

 10/30/1812 Fri 07:55:32  836b935268 "“Oh, please... May I stay with you?” cried Pétya."
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:56:06  73c266d72d "“But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?” asked"
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:57:30  b79c69f99c "Denísov."
 10/30/1812 Fri 07:58:45  b4be3d1dc9 "Pétya blushed."
 10/30/1812 Fri 08:00:05  35917d0615 "“He gave me no instructions. I think I could?” he returned, inquiringly."
 10/30/1812 Fri 08:01:50  f4b7a2de62 "“Well, all wight,” said Denísov."
 10/30/1812 Fri 08:03:59  e5e2a54267 "And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place"
 10/30/1812 Fri 08:04:35  c2978039b0 "arranged near the watchman’s hut in the forest, and told the officer on"

 10/30/1812 Fri 08:33:09  17588a5f57 "had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to"
 10/30/1812 Fri 08:35:33  37c5a5b7da "them with his hand."
 10/30/1812 Fri 08:36:25  ee7823e2a5 "Denísov and Pétya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant was"
 10/30/1812 Fri 08:37:04  75b5ae723b "standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, on a"
 10/30/1812 Fri 08:39:33  67ffa12c0d "downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a steep"
 10/30/1812 Fri 08:41:19  c0deace001 "ravine, was a small village and a landowner’s house with a broken roof."

 10/30/1812 Fri 08:45:21  a3cbebd8d3 "away, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist. Their"

 10/30/1812 Fri 08:59:05  d51b32db32 "lifting his eyebrows, looked at Denísov in affright, but in spite of"

 10/30/1812 Fri 09:02:41  b6f6603f66 "assenting to everything Denísov asked him. Denísov turned away from him"
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:03:39  b7c03687fb "frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him."
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:06:02  81d7b3c9d0 "Pétya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now"

 10/30/1812 Fri 09:10:11  4b124ed33c "along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance."
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:11:38  c2d9a4f349 "“Whether Dólokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?” said Denísov with"
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:12:12  3a282fbb0c "a merry sparkle in his eyes."
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:13:29  3bcaa085ba "“It is a very suitable spot,” said the esaul."

 10/30/1812 Fri 09:25:03  663d449bfd "While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded"
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:26:26  fff8b9afb5 "from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then"
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:28:23  0102fac457 "another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices"
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:29:30  87bb28b683 "shouting together came up from the slope. For a moment Denísov and the"
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:31:19  832f147a8d "esaul drew back. They were so near that they thought they were the cause"
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:33:48  6dd26cdbd1 "of the firing and shouting. But the firing and shouting did not relate"
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:35:14  d20a3d9af0 "to them. Down below, a man wearing something red was running through the"
 10/30/1812 Fri 09:36:12  8e61c4c169 "marsh. The French were evidently firing and shouting at him."

 10/30/1812 Fri 10:17:11  8d18751ac5 "“We don’t do the French any harm,” said Tíkhon, evidently frightened by"

 10/30/1812 Fri 10:46:45  67f2bd17b5 "done—to push a cart out of the mud with one’s shoulders, pull a horse"

 10/30/1812 Fri 11:05:27  fb7a371ca4 "angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect"
 10/30/1812 Fri 11:07:37  448b1a4054 "of this incident on Tíkhon was that after being wounded he seldom"
 10/30/1812 Fri 11:08:42  a0918409d8 "brought in prisoners."

 10/30/1812 Fri 11:38:52  c33d9589f5 "into the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and"
 10/30/1812 Fri 11:39:52  d867b46631 "approached his commander. It was Tíkhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked"
 10/30/1812 Fri 11:41:00  309cef8238 "face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He"
 10/30/1812 Fri 11:42:20  c0db53a2e2 "lifted his head high and gazed at Denísov as if repressing a laugh."

 10/30/1812 Fri 16:42:20  b3e0077f92 "not sent away with the other prisoners. Pétya had heard in the army many"

 10/30/1812 Fri 16:56:10  9041ec35ee "a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most correct officer of"
 10/30/1812 Fri 16:58:15  0bc2c64c3f "the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman’s padded coat with"

 10/30/1812 Fri 17:05:11  5a2f31d990 "questioning him about the matter in hand. Denísov told him of the"

 10/30/1812 Fri 22:06:58  c701417ffa "munching their oats. In the dark Pétya recognized his own horse, which"

 10/31/1812 Sat 00:10:27  8e9e6f56ec "fresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody"
 10/31/1812 Sat 00:11:44  a1d9193a8d "grew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was"
 10/31/1812 Sat 00:13:25  815cc38ad0 "a fugue—though Pétya had not the least conception of what a fugue is."
 10/31/1812 Sat 00:14:53  9ff7150503 "Each instrument—now resembling a violin and now a horn, but better"
 10/31/1812 Sat 00:15:25  1f059f6e87 "and clearer than violin or horn—played its own part, and before it had"

 10/31/1812 Sat 00:20:42  28c1793433 "one and again became separate and again blended, now into solemn church"

 10/31/1812 Sat 00:39:22  59265e5a2f "increasingly triumphant sounds. “Now voices join in!” ordered Pétya. And"
 10/31/1812 Sat 00:41:18  7f81278a47 "at first from afar he heard men’s voices and then women’s. The voices"
 10/31/1812 Sat 00:43:10  9768ed6269 "grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and Pétya listened to their"

 10/31/1812 Sat 00:55:17  1706b054fc "share it. He was awakened by Likhachëv’s kindly voice."

 11/02/1812 Mon 05:03:17  037727c13b "had learned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and"

 11/02/1812 Mon 05:25:17  7f92957e4f "was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed"
 11/02/1812 Mon 05:27:32  4ad3487efa "occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special"
 11/02/1812 Mon 05:28:48  86e605d757 "of his own. The difference between his former and present self was that"

 11/02/1812 Mon 05:37:40  50310fdc60 "was before him and listened to what was said, though evidently seeing"
 11/02/1812 Mon 05:39:57  3a9bfc5e54 "and hearing something quite different. Formerly he had appeared to be"
 11/02/1812 Mon 05:41:23  67bfa03d6b "a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so people had been inclined to avoid"
 11/02/1812 Mon 05:42:19  0dea89894a "him. Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and"

 11/02/1812 Mon 07:21:12  c0deace001 "behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into"

 11/02/1812 Mon 07:30:52  476e6967fa "he had been like that himself but a short time before."
 11/02/1812 Mon 07:31:58  b0194ec3c2 "Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs,"

 11/02/1812 Mon 07:33:39  7190897d69 "occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all"
 11/02/1812 Mon 07:34:18  f16c453501 "contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his"

 11/02/1812 Mon 07:40:08  186b22a8d3 "joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, was interested in this"

 11/02/1812 Mon 07:45:20  16c4501629 "gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 07:46:29  c630e78eb8 "the impossibility of changing a man’s convictions by words, and his"
 11/02/1812 Mon 07:48:05  bfba8d1b92 "recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing"
 11/02/1812 Mon 07:49:29  53bf538adc "things each from his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of"

 11/02/1812 Mon 12:15:38  520308d2b6 "was in Moscow and living in her house—which had not been burned—in"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:18:01  caacea4875 "Vozdvízhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her."
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:18:39  c0deace001 "On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:20:50  33cac0991b "friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:21:24  22b3659767 "one at Borodinó."
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:22:52  fad8c71db6 "“Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:24:38  c0deace001 "Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:25:46  22cd4db507 "before he died?” thought Pierre. He recalled Karatáev and his death and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:28:01  3c9ab93d11 "involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:29:48  0897f9db04 "similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:30:23  c0deace001 "felt for both of them."
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:31:14  61da53d602 "Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood."
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:32:10  b159342633 "The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:33:20  f121fb6b66 "general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:33:54  e25a1a3026 "stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:35:16  4453020f02 "of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:37:36  234c260dd3 "informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments, and that"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:39:23  f9e3e2845f "she received on Sundays."
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:40:34  cd5d77fe6f "“Announce me. Perhaps she will see me,” said Pierre."
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:41:54  d373900a57 "“Yes, sir,” said the man. “Please step into the portrait gallery.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:43:47  7e4bfa6030 "A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:44:49  7798ac45de "word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:45:49  af1b72f927 "would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment."
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:48:06  70842ace1a "In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:49:20  abf5a2ee20 "another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:49:51  caf01d59e3 "always had lady companions, but who they were and what they were like"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:51:32  237470a077 "he never knew or remembered. “This must be one of her companions,” he"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:53:08  82187a284f "thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress."
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:53:55  f6d803bf49 "The princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand."
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:55:29  144874d3dd "“Yes,” she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:57:05  ffeaa49e43 "hand, “so this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the very"
 11/02/1812 Mon 12:58:49  58077811cd "last,” she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:00:04  fa7ba4d699 "shyness that surprised him for an instant."
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:01:36  a22e26720a "“I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:02:11  90b5e106d5 "news we had received for a long time.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:04:34  e87c0ae83a "Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:07:02  c0deace001 "uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:09:11  bff8e8b662 "interrupted her."
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:10:56  5bbdeba1e3 "“Just imagine—I knew nothing about him!” said he. “I thought he had been"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:12:06  23f4c68861 "killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know that"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:13:29  57c54fd401 "he fell in with the Rostóvs.... What a strange coincidence!”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:15:28  ad020ebaf6 "Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:16:56  2ad2821235 "companion’s face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:19:00  3abbf3ec67 "as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:21:03  83c83341a4 "in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:23:23  a6898548a3 "hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary."
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:25:09  a94d6195f0 "But when he mentioned the Rostóvs, Princess Mary’s face expressed still"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:26:29  3d32ad16a9 "greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre’s face to"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:27:30  23240f9095 "that of the lady in the black dress and said:"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:28:06  f9f6247447 "“Do you really not recognize her?”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:28:41  bc8c284bf5 "Pierre looked again at the companion’s pale, delicate face with its"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:30:07  d34a9e82f8 "black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:31:06  72f0d6f614 "and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes."
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:33:20  119d608b69 "“But no, it can’t be!” he thought. “This stern, thin, pale face that"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:35:30  67ccddca61 "looks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:36:30  bc89b4f9b1 "But at that moment Princess Mary said, “Natásha!” And with difficulty,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:37:55  fbdd3ca050 "effort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:39:04  83d42589d5 "hinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:40:22  944e4192b0 "that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:42:44  64522c2853 "a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:44:59  1f20081a9c "thinking—especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:47:23  c0deace001 "enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possible,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:48:41  026fa7c615 "it was Natásha and he loved her."
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:51:10  927c41bc78 "At that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:52:03  e87a864d5e "and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware."
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:53:11  c3ec4879ca "He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:54:15  755a6baf89 "agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more clearly—clearer"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:56:39  7cdcfdc740 "than any words could have done—did he betray to himself, to her, and to"
 11/02/1812 Mon 13:58:55  cbfa9b65e5 "Princess Mary that he loved her."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:00:31  7dc0edb212 "“No, it’s only the unexpectedness of it,” thought Pierre. But as soon as"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:01:48  629a0095d8 "he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:03:33  2f78f2160f "again glanced at Natásha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:05:59  fd2341d62b "a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:06:42  c8c35f0c29 "became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:08:00  baf3597dad "saying."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:10:08  25d81bf9e6 "Pierre had failed to notice Natásha because he did not at all expect to"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:12:00  963edf5ddf "see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the change in"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:14:01  4eecee3352 "her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin and pale, but"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:14:33  867b279afa "that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:16:31  1aa511ec97 "moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:18:29  5932d47d29 "a suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:19:57  1b2d0b11e8 "glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:22:24  7736902966 "were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:23:59  0094c59350 "Pierre’s confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natásha’s part,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:24:59  6c75acf0e1 "but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:25:49  719ca1c51a "CHAPTER XVI"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:26:19  ff16286942 "“She has come to stay with me,” said Princess Mary. “The count and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:27:58  c0deace001 "countess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:30:12  d85a9b549d "state; but it was necessary for Natásha herself to see a doctor. They"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:31:37  b0dee0c006 "insisted on her coming with me.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:33:01  5f15089205 "“Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?” said Pierre, addressing"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:33:45  664d8c7d72 "Natásha. “You know it happened the very day we were rescued. I saw him."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:35:50  c327822936 "What a delightful boy he was!”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:37:06  9b57099f6f "Natásha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:38:13  d32dfa1d72 "widened and lit up."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:38:56  a09e138dff "“What can one say or think of as a consolation?” said Pierre. “Nothing!"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:40:38  c0deace001 "Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:43:07  05a4c22b3d "“Yes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...” remarked"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:43:48  b14407bb6d "Princess Mary."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:45:28  4772a3dc80 "“Yes, yes, that is really true,” Pierre hastily interrupted her."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:47:12  8941244618 "“Why is it true?” Natásha asked, looking attentively into Pierre’s eyes."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:47:49  dc90aef259 "“How can you ask why?” said Princess Mary. “The thought alone of what"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:49:35  0adfcb2fc1 "awaits...”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:52:00  69534bf081 "Natásha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:54:16  c0deace001 "inquiringly at Pierre."
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:56:04  3cc1601784 "“And because,” Pierre continued, “only one who believes that there is a"
 11/02/1812 Mon 14:58:22  73f75bab0f "God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:00:50  88461c44cb "Natásha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:02:06  2a344f49f5 "Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:03:14  efa5065249 "asking about his friend’s last days."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:05:32  0f1ce43793 "Pierre’s confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he felt"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:07:53  2ca81ccc17 "that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was now a"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:09:31  de245b0747 "judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:10:09  5c3c6c9ac1 "him than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:12:23  f3ebfa504d "considering what impression his words would make on Natásha. He did"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:13:11  29e6f975f6 "not purposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:14:41  aa1ec37b4a "regarded from her standpoint."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:16:39  e32d05c54a "Princess Mary—reluctantly as is usual in such cases—began telling of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:18:14  268ef62e06 "the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But Pierre’s face"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:20:30  feccf7a6ec "quivering with emotion, his questions and his eager restless expression,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:22:42  f35ff6efdd "gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:23:44  dd819953a7 "for her own sake."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:24:46  955dd6864a "“Yes, yes, and so...?” Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:25:27  1eea73b612 "his whole body and eagerly listened to her story. “Yes, yes... so he"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:26:42  f35fb73647 "grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:28:57  b5e1439f1d "one thing—to be perfectly good—so he could not be afraid of death. The"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:30:01  8a5ed789c3 "faults he had—if he had any—were not of his making. So he did soften?..."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:31:08  19d2cb0319 "What a happy thing that he saw you again,” he added, suddenly turning to"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:33:26  d073dc13c5 "Natásha and looking at her with eyes full of tears."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:35:33  648b34098d "Natásha’s face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:37:46  c0deace001 "She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:39:09  b19053170d "“Yes, that was happiness,” she then said in her quiet voice with its"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:41:17  233478b6a4 "deep chest notes. “For me it certainly was happiness.” She paused. “And"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:43:20  2383a88a24 "he... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:45:21  70b99b7e3f "the room....”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:46:39  5c25bd850a "Natásha’s voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:48:22  c3fdc81f5d "knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:50:13  37a9dd7a30 "head and began to speak rapidly."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:52:18  853061f13c "“We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:54:39  5551c1e49b "ask about him. Then suddenly Sónya told me he was traveling with us. I"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:56:18  f110bf9f48 "had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was"
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:58:06  584bdba047 "to see him and be with him,” she said, trembling, and breathing quickly."
 11/02/1812 Mon 15:59:36  22c8494f10 "And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:01:15  116b3c3d24 "never yet mentioned to anyone—all she had lived through during those"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:02:39  31ae4dbe32 "three weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslávl."
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:04:19  7a38299e6d "Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:04:58  a2e1fc16e8 "tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of death,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:05:43  c0deace001 "nor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only pity for"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:08:09  71826cba01 "her, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking."
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:10:28  b0d5939fb8 "Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:11:37  df6e0cecaa "Natásha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:12:27  19603f0d6c "her brother’s and Natásha’s love."
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:12:58  06de27af71 "Evidently Natásha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale."
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:14:44  084dc78fc5 "She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:17:11  5639e856ff "her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:18:08  2ca01620fd "repeated the same thing twice."
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:20:31  126bef1f6d "Dessalles’ voice was heard outside the door asking whether little"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:22:46  2f569b15ce "Nicholas might come in to say good night."
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:23:20  baa3821fd3 "“Well, that’s all—everything,” said Natásha."
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:25:27  f27934bafb "She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the door"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:27:30  1c496230de "which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:28:57  3e9181b7b3 "from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow."
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:30:34  f6c8dc4f76 "Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not"
 11/02/1812 Mon 16:32:10  64a98d79fd "understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world."

 11/02/1812 Mon 17:09:39  d665b946af "and, resolving to break the silence, looked at Natásha and at Princess"
 11/02/1812 Mon 17:11:54  c44b2a6edb "Mary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of"

 11/02/1812 Mon 17:26:39  9689a4d2aa "easy to be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people"

 11/02/1812 Mon 18:20:45  20318006ff "means being Napoleon’s guest. Not only did I never see him but I heard"

 11/02/1812 Mon 18:34:51  1875b2e51e "At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:35:45  30b10c0540 "him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:37:00  d86242a3db "to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:38:35  c0deace001 "unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:40:18  07c2027fb2 "emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:41:58  d306d69002 "has lived through."

 11/02/1812 Mon 18:45:38  41276b0de9 "Natásha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness."
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:46:31  fd1713023a "Natásha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:48:41  eb0fd3aa19 "changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:49:19  0a43bfe1e3 "wandered—evidently herself experiencing all that he described. Not only"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:49:50  fc1c994d84 "her look, but her exclamations and the brief questions she put, showed"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:51:59  29f65f0296 "Pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey. It was clear"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:53:21  1f23a31abc "that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:54:55  724afef0b7 "but could not, express in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:56:53  ef8ec6cb89 "with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was"
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:58:11  4a1de1a0a7 "this: “It was an awful sight—children abandoned, some in the flames..."
 11/02/1812 Mon 18:59:42  2d47adfff5 "One was snatched out before my eyes... and there were women who had"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:00:48  8807277153 "their things snatched off and their earrings torn out...” he flushed and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:02:56  f2031c29a8 "grew confused. “Then a patrol arrived and all the men—all those who were"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:05:12  25c2b189af "not looting, that is—were arrested, and I among them.”"

 11/02/1812 Mon 19:09:36  8beffd6d4a "Pierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:11:19  038a15a525 "over the horrible details, but Natásha insisted that he should not omit"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:12:02  58f846047a "anything."
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:13:56  dacdc2ba89 "Pierre began to tell about Karatáev, but paused. By this time he had"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:14:51  25ae9c9452 "risen from the table and was pacing the room, Natásha following him with"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:16:55  179d0f0404 "her eyes. Then he added:"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:18:37  3b0f90d6be "“No, you can’t understand what I learned from that illiterate man—that"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:19:48  747165c984 "simple fellow.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:20:38  9d0128a85a "“Yes, yes, go on!” said Natásha. “Where is he?”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:21:17  a9a2a0b95e "“They killed him almost before my eyes.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:23:02  ea7be39620 "And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:24:57  1496cb5259 "days of their retreat, of Karatáev’s illness and his death."
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:26:47  9693916dd2 "He told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now, as"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:27:38  c49292a2af "it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that he was"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:29:07  d98893d0b6 "telling it all to Natásha he experienced that pleasure which a man has"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:31:20  d5b4258a44 "when women listen to him—not clever women who when listening either try"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:31:51  c0deace001 "to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:33:57  b4aa9aabb5 "offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:36:07  513ca768bc "own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:38:28  d5473532d6 "little mental workshop—but the pleasure given by real women gifted with"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:39:30  300ecf3bde "a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself."
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:41:01  dfc026610f "Natásha without knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:42:02  2b2673cf81 "no single quiver in Pierre’s voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:44:05  d0d8a4be9c "his face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:46:12  3d9854c665 "flight and took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:46:51  0175a85516 "meaning of all Pierre’s mental travail."
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:48:40  874a91b0bc "Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:49:33  2289c8ed93 "now saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:51:39  630daff628 "possibility of love and happiness between Natásha and Pierre, and the"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:52:15  da0ff226c5 "first thought of this filled her heart with gladness."
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:54:14  0ce3a3f552 "It was three o’clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:55:33  29743c292c "stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them."
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:56:23  8becd53237 "Pierre finished his story. Natásha continued to look at him intently"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:57:46  9e021d9fc0 "with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand"
 11/02/1812 Mon 19:59:22  812e406343 "something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:01:46  a486a14daf "and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:04:13  a4311ad04a "to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:06:23  825ca3db73 "occurred to none of them that it was three o’clock and time to go to"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:06:59  5ce56068b2 "bed."
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:07:36  391908d6d8 "“People speak of misfortunes and sufferings,” remarked Pierre, “but if"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:09:01  92ea29e7cc "at this moment I were asked: ‘Would you rather be what you were before"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:11:02  f2159c8f49 "you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?’ then for"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:12:59  8446e40bac "heaven’s sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:14:38  8c807a3d6b "that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:15:38  caba081c9d "only then that what is new and good begins. While there is life there is"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:17:10  25d5fe88cb "happiness. There is much, much before us. I say this to you,” he added,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:18:42  a637c02b98 "turning to Natásha."
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:20:34  357f5b8d29 "“Yes, yes,” she said, answering something quite different. “I too should"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:21:34  d9c8b95e8d "wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:22:47  b5abbfbc45 "Pierre looked intently at her."
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:24:30  65a382d06c "“Yes, and nothing more,” said Natásha."
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:26:02  cedf47aeaf "“It’s not true, not true!” cried Pierre. “I am not to blame for being"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:28:08  6681c769f8 "alive and wishing to live—nor you either.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:30:23  660fd894aa "Suddenly Natásha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:31:20  ccdcb6a15d "began to cry."
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:33:03  2530fdca3b "“What is it, Natásha?” said Princess Mary."
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:35:19  abb1564458 "“Nothing, nothing.” She smiled at Pierre through her tears. “Good night!"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:37:27  2e6d0f6570 "It is time for bed.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:39:26  bb7c85a4ad "Pierre rose and took his leave."
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:41:18  d354c75427 "Princess Mary and Natásha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:43:33  da458b1197 "what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:45:01  ab6f5174d2 "Pierre nor did Natásha speak of him."
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:45:34  e5fc49c559 "“Well, good night, Mary!” said Natásha. “Do you know, I am often afraid"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:46:09  faec19a740 "that by not speaking of him” (she meant Prince Andrew) “for fear of not"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:48:22  0c2372e246 "doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.”"

 11/02/1812 Mon 20:54:26  c0deace001 "“Is it possible to forget?” said she."
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:56:54  16056b7da5 "“It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 20:58:56  ef4cebad8e "painful, but good, very good!” said Natásha. “I am sure he really loved"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:00:55  f1f3480f82 "him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?” she added, suddenly"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:02:54  fdc623cb0a "blushing."
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:04:15  e69d31a76e "“To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!” said Princess"

 11/02/1812 Mon 21:07:45  d2bba0cbd0 "“Do you know, Mary...” Natásha suddenly said with a mischievous smile"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:10:08  cb6c3059fd "such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, “he has"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:12:19  c0deace001 "somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh—as if he had just come out of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:13:04  521f76e6d2 "a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn’t it true?”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:13:50  d7b14fbe21 "“Yes,” replied Princess Mary. “He has greatly improved.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:14:47  2311d9580d "“With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:16:34  d58c36c631 "had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:18:56  810a711cb6 "“I understand why he” (Prince Andrew) “liked no one so much as him,”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:19:30  b84c9eb4d0 "said Princess Mary."
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:21:44  c2a0c4dc83 "“Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when they"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:23:19  c0deace001 "are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike him—in"

 11/02/1812 Mon 21:34:18  a944e5eba6 "It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:35:48  ab6a1f1dce "up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:36:29  5215832ee1 "and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:37:47  bec6e263bb "smiling happily."
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:38:50  3794dba386 "He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natásha, and of their love, at one"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:40:13  4e7c1b686c "moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling."
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:41:29  bb9fe4b853 "It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:42:04  77223ba8ff "room."
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:42:56  b77ebb637d "“Well, what’s to be done if it cannot be avoided? What’s to be done?"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:43:33  b6b12f0ccd "Evidently it has to be so,” said he to himself, and hastily undressing"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:44:59  631e91ce6a "he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:46:30  d900e6a4f2 "indecision."
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:48:59  b6900d16ec "“Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:50:10  d8b6e5a54e "that she and I may be man and wife,” he told himself."
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:51:14  849241cd91 "A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:52:49  3824049aaf "Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savélich came to ask him about"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:54:15  8402cb2a99 "packing for the journey."
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:55:35  b1e047fe17 "“What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:57:30  851d195e8d "he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. “Oh, yes, long ago"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:58:05  e3a1b34afa "before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 21:59:09  059468c3ae "he reflected. “Why? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:01:00  37d27d0aee "how attentive, and how he remembers everything,” he thought, looking at"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:03:11  c9447de11f "Savélich’s old face, “and what a pleasant smile he has!”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:05:12  60b8179395 "“Well, Savélich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?” Pierre"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:06:54  9e9adf0566 "asked him."
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:08:19  59335fc583 "“What’s the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under the"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:10:47  efd27a802f "late count—the kingdom of heaven be his!—and we have lived under you"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:11:35  92f9cd3bc7 "too, without ever being wronged.”"

 11/02/1812 Mon 22:15:44  0db61ea2ae "“The children will live just the same. With such masters one can live.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:17:33  c0deace001 "“But what about my heirs?” said Pierre. “Supposing I suddenly marry..."
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:18:17  c8e038e65f "it might happen,” he added with an involuntary smile."
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:20:17  7d0e50522b "“If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:22:26  c0deace001 "“How easy he thinks it,” thought Pierre. “He doesn’t know how terrible"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:23:19  4d3a0818f8 "it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:24:14  354aea8a11 "“So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?” asked Savélich."
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:25:28  c0deace001 "“No, I’ll put it off for a bit. I’ll tell you later. You must forgive"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:26:23  61ab4e7481 "the trouble I have put you to,” said Pierre, and seeing Savélich smile,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:28:33  fd5c9d5d0c "he thought: “But how strange it is that he should not know that now"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:30:41  e4d4db7f10 "there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:31:27  b7bb8092b4 "all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:32:10  5a0e475ffd "I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?” Pierre reflected. “No,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:32:52  6025a102c2 "another time.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:34:44  318ca238d7 "At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to"

 11/02/1812 Mon 22:37:47  94c5d43c4f "Natásha Rostóva!”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:38:56  ad9251e45e "The princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:40:32  bdb579f536 "had seen Anna Semënovna."
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:42:38  067b37502c "“Do you know her?” asked Pierre."
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:43:08  7c0e82dc9c "“I have seen the princess,” she replied. “I heard that they were"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:44:17  c0deace001 "arranging a match for her with young Rostóv. It would be a very good"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:45:52  8f537c27a7 "thing for the Rostóvs, they are said to be utterly ruined.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:47:57  5898f070ce "“No; I mean do you know Natásha Rostóva?”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:49:25  1199031c9a "“I heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:51:10  9f7de2fd80 "“No, she either doesn’t understand or is pretending,” thought Pierre."
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:53:10  1b43733cf9 "“Better not say anything to her either.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:53:52  fc6ede7549 "The princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre’s journey."
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:54:56  946ee927ae "“How kind they all are,” thought Pierre. “What is surprising is that"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:55:39  bd5a306220 "they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:56:36  2dcd1b552c "interest to them. And all for me!”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 22:57:10  a63239ec9d "On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send"

 11/02/1812 Mon 23:01:09  49014d5c87 "returned to their owners that day."
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:02:06  a6959f5883 "“And this man too,” thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:02:46  30c6f12de0 "of Police. “What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:05:07  2d0f4f5713 "bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:06:41  28852691c6 "and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn’t he take bribes?"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:07:46  91b47c3e54 "That’s the way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:09:39  9e98500f2f "kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me.”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:10:52  c0deace001 "Pierre went to Princess Mary’s to dinner."
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:12:51  8cb911f3b9 "As he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:14:16  242c398c36 "down, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:14:52  f3945ac241 "of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:15:52  6538dec117 "of the town, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:18:12  510b87eee9 "the Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers,"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:19:27  57b0588f52 "the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:21:26  f5f82db2da "hawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked at him with cheerful beaming"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:23:14  05b009757a "eyes that seemed to say: “Ah, there he is! Let’s see what will come of"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:24:21  3ddac0d7b4 "it!”"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:24:59  cb1e003065 "At the entrance to Princess Mary’s house Pierre felt doubtful whether"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:25:47  2f3a7a7049 "he had really been there the night before and really seen Natásha and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:27:59  a824ef2e27 "talked to her. “Perhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:30:12  828c1788af "no one there.” But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:31:58  5f5ac00b8b "presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom. She"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:33:25  777052bcde "was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:35:00  87479b247e "same way as the day before, yet she was quite different. Had she been"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:36:59  b6d403c8bb "like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:39:00  f2ab61aea6 "failed to recognize her."
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:40:41  bf47dbfec8 "She was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:43:07  4835857dfe "Andrew’s fiancée. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:45:04  9b40200234 "her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression."
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:46:38  d5f3b8480c "Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there, but"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:48:10  21ff208e80 "Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her."
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:50:34  f3e421f585 "Next day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:52:10  a7813ce45d "Princess Mary and Natásha were evidently glad to see their visitor and"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:53:25  0743204b16 "though all Pierre’s interest was now centered in that house, by the"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:54:54  c612b49378 "evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:56:58  a3b347cf70 "one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:57:37  79ec621d03 "that Princess Mary and Natásha exchanged glances, evidently wondering"
 11/02/1812 Mon 23:59:41  a48324c17e "when he would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:00:29  a6787470bc "and embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:02:37  05dc2b788c "his leave."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:03:28  e3c5fa3af4 "Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:04:22  3cd8b2f30c "a headache began to say good night."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:04:52  7f2073064e "“So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?” she asked."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:05:33  c0deace001 "“No, I am not going,” Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:07:32  a98fe27825 "though offended. “Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow—but I won’t say"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:09:24  8e43c7cec8 "good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,”"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:11:24  0f80cf5e16 "said he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:13:24  03eed9c4d8 "his departure."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:15:34  771ed5acae "Natásha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other hand"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:17:17  0c7557adfa "instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:18:52  5d3bc0ca29 "intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:20:19  2fa947af6f "had plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:20:51  514c49e5c3 "long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:21:32  7200ba8b86 "When Natásha left the room Pierre’s confusion and awkwardness"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:22:28  d0f67933d0 "immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:24:32  a66ab9eb0d "moved an armchair toward Princess Mary."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:26:16  8e22a7613e "“Yes, I wanted to tell you,” said he, answering her look as if she had"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:27:00  1f7119b5bd "spoken. “Princess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:28:31  0b6a0db959 "dear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:29:11  796e8d8957 "know it’s impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:30:49  e11ec748ef "her. No, not that, I don’t, I can’t...”"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:32:07  001e12b343 "He paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:33:53  0a03d6024a "“Well,” he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:36:17  465cf36a2d "“I don’t know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:38:26  9dab8d3584 "alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:39:46  504b96acfd "her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:42:11  8cc2de2a89 "perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:43:46  c0deace001 "possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope?"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:45:41  b911fbf057 "Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!” he added after a pause, and"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:47:37  88dc09a1e6 "touched her hand as she did not reply."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:49:31  bd0c04144a "“I am thinking of what you have told me,” answered Princess Mary."
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:51:26  f71add0dec "“This is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at"

 11/03/1812 Tue 00:54:13  6570024043 "Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:55:30  1a3b520c2b "impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:56:52  7b3d68bdc4 "in Natásha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre"
 11/03/1812 Tue 00:59:10  39bb996707 "spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for."
