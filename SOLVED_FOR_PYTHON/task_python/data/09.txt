 10/21/1812 Wed 21:34:47  591146cead "pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor"

 10/22/1812 Thu 01:08:48  6e29f0421c "is that?” he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:11:09  83f03e0b95 "overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face."

 10/22/1812 Thu 01:26:37  e577a217b8 "“It’s a complicated story, you know,” said the adjutant. “That"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:28:23  8929c410b6 "proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:29:47  f8e3340937 "it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivánovich"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:30:47  7cd8b57545 "here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:31:43  2da49f3289 "sixty-three hands. He asked one, ‘From whom did you get it?’ ‘From"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:32:58  8dd55ccd80 "so-and-so.’ He went to the next one. ‘From whom did you get it?’ and so"

 10/22/1812 Thu 01:36:56  e0730cd763 "pet of a trader,’” said the adjutant smiling. “They asked him, ‘Who gave"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:39:03  023be57b65 "it you?’ And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:41:31  a24ab2eeb3 "only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:42:37  569898ad5b "some understanding. He replied: ‘From no one; I made it up myself.’"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:43:55  0d42a2f9ef "They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: ‘I made it"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:44:47  0725b7adbe "up myself.’ And so it was reported to the count, who sent for the man."
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:45:37  ec646d70b8 "‘From whom did you get the proclamation?’ ‘I wrote it myself.’ Well, you"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:47:44  666f0b7df7 "know the count,” said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride,"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:49:47  3213a15b20 "“he flared up dreadfully—and just think of the fellow’s audacity, lying,"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:51:04  98ad79cf4d "and obstinacy!”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:51:49  6f0fa5dc82 "“And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharëv? I understand!”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:52:59  e2827bb5be "said Pierre."
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:53:59  6d147e8ca4 "“Not at all,” rejoined the adjutant in dismay. “Klyucharëv had his own"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:54:44  5d9ac5a267 "sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished."
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:56:44  92d7d2cf11 "But the point is that the count was much annoyed. ‘How could you have"
 10/22/1812 Thu 01:58:34  be04b17937 "written it yourself?’ said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:00:33  23885616f4 "was lying on the table. ‘Here it is! You did not write it yourself but"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:02:35  9cd244c7ce "translated it, and translated it abominably, because you don’t even know"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:04:33  a17a9efd35 "French, you fool.’ And what do you think? ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have not"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:06:29  55202d38b4 "read any papers, I made it up myself.’ ‘If that’s so, you’re a traitor"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:07:42  8dad00afc5 "and I’ll have you tried, and you’ll be hanged! Say from whom you had"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:08:22  e3e765fb5f "it.’ ‘I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.’ And that was the end"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:10:45  82e68bc98e "of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it."
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:11:41  c0deace001 "He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:12:51  eb6fdb72fe "father has come to intercede for him. But he’s a good-for-nothing lad!"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:14:18  a616cd7f39 "You know that sort of tradesman’s son, a dandy and lady-killer. He"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:16:33  08a3e63031 "attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:18:28  5b4e62b2ea "for him. That’s the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:19:07  9b50de07d1 "here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:21:32  a0d8276326 "Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other."
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:23:05  9006c189df "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?"
 10/22/1812 Thu 02:25:21  130a9d12ea "He found some scoundrel of a painter...”"

 10/22/1812 Thu 15:55:24  c0993c2c45 "Berg, the Rostóvs’ son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders"
 10/22/1812 Thu 15:56:46  042c5dfa9b "of Vladímir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post"
 10/22/1812 Thu 15:58:07  9e415d1ea2 "of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:00:03  66e607ed19 "first division of the Second Army."
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:01:44  c5152e0fd5 "On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army."
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:03:30  5f22bd9b8f "He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:05:17  431dfea7e7 "army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there."
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:06:37  7dfd1ea838 "So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:07:10  4c063d389a "domestic reasons."
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:07:53  c0deace001 "Berg drove up to his father-in-law’s house in his spruce little trap"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:10:14  7ab47d10cd "with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:10:44  b7d6c967e6 "looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:12:19  a7e7b103d3 "porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it."
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:13:46  b4cc2b0a6e "From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:14:40  1d0256f38e "drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of Natásha"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:15:44  7d0c1adb30 "and Sónya, and hastened to inquire after “Mamma’s” health."
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:17:23  1c3813d03b "“Health, at a time like this?” said the count. “Come, tell us the news!"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:18:43  df4fb330e4 "Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?”"

 10/22/1812 Thu 16:23:34  be92cbe5a0 "in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly"

 10/22/1812 Thu 16:33:56  e78b669ab9 "Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the"

 10/22/1812 Thu 16:43:01  67db060aed "And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:43:33  57fe737e69 "heard those days. Natásha watched him with an intent gaze that confused"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:44:47  272e5af845 "him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:46:11  64e7c3bc7f "question."
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:47:25  c0deace001 "“Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:48:54  8ee432254b "cannot be imagined or adequately praised!” said Berg, glancing round"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:49:41  880c680b0f "at Natásha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:50:34  3c893e36af "look with a smile. “‘Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:52:03  9c5686ddc3 "her sons!’ Isn’t it so, Papa?” said he."
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:53:48  cec3ec3c43 "Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:55:38  8455cd0e79 "dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand,"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:57:31  c0deace001 "asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to"
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:58:22  3551002f9c "express sympathy, remained standing beside her."
 10/22/1812 Thu 16:58:57  18e17373d6 "“Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:00:33  f430fafc50 "every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get"

 10/22/1812 Thu 17:03:08  c0deace001 "“I can’t think what the servants are about,” said the countess, turning"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:03:49  7895e3ea5f "to her husband. “I have just been told that nothing is ready yet."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:05:19  9215e13de7 "Somebody after all must see to things. One misses Mítenka at such times."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:05:54  3412fa693b "There won’t be any end to it.”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:08:23  20ecda37db "The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:09:08  783e74ae37 "He got up from his chair and went to the door."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:09:58  d3a2417f8b "At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:12:26  fca7daa3bf "and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:13:48  43b5ca1451 "significantly."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:14:57  c0deace001 "“And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,” said he."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:15:47  5a8ec98c3c "“Hm...” said the count, and stopped."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:16:32  9c7f84ba03 "“I was driving past Yusúpov’s house just now,” said Berg with a laugh,"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:17:53  bdc8cef6ce "“when the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldn’t"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:19:19  2a0c886e4d "buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:20:58  517e2ce1cd "small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear Véra wanted a"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:22:56  e0b7750877 "chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.” (At the mention"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:25:01  93eccd5bde "of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:25:39  534aeb1620 "to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) “And it’s"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:27:54  10dd65ee04 "such a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know!"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:30:22  abefa04bd1 "And dear Véra has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:31:51  b327e1a90b "see. I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:33:13  d03ed2b340 "have one, I will pay the man well, and...”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:34:54  f2f7a7905d "The count frowned and coughed."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:35:46  8ec0d7f616 "“Ask the countess, I don’t give orders.”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:36:57  9523edce0f "“If it’s inconvenient, please don’t,” said Berg. “Only I so wanted it,"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:38:51  3476a32420 "for dear Véra’s sake.”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:39:41  d99ac2667b "“Oh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil...”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:41:58  eee949e88f "cried the old count. “My head’s in a whirl!”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:44:18  ba033f8c9d "And he left the room. The countess began to cry."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:46:17  b8e96edf24 "“Yes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!” said Berg."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:47:35  16acbe2cb3 "Natásha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:48:06  fe722f8de7 "reach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:49:06  7a4e1ce599 "Pétya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:50:21  4e1906cacd "who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:52:44  3816dd3d6a "yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing"
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:53:51  ff3ee4787c "into one of them helped by an orderly."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:55:27  4f8fe69725 "“Do you know what it’s about?” Pétya asked Natásha."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:57:48  65407872c8 "She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about."
 10/22/1812 Thu 17:59:39  423a75bce3 "She did not answer."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:01:46  bc115196f4 "“It’s because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded,” said"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:02:57  851951429d "Pétya. “Vasílich told me. I consider...”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:05:08  1bd77abb50 "“I consider,” Natásha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:07:30  150d8fd1bc "Pétya, “I consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I don’t know what."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:09:24  1160848967 "Are we despicable Germans?”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:10:31  fb0fa49d77 "Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:11:55  c0deace001 "letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:12:30  872e43c8fc "headlong up the stairs."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:13:54  687a8abc1a "Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:14:54  e79c5f299b "attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:17:19  8469d80aa3 "the room, when Natásha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:19:43  b7f28b8696 "tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:21:35  285449f96c "“It’s horrid! It’s abominable!” she screamed. “You can’t possibly have"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:23:11  bbfa8be9a0 "ordered it!”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:23:49  cc3aa0a921 "Berg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:26:15  10cf293c45 "stood still at the window and listened."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:27:16  05ace5626b "“Mamma, it’s impossible: see what is going on in the yard!” she cried."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:28:14  00765923db "“They will be left!...”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:30:19  c0deace001 "“What’s the matter with you? Who are ‘they’? What do you want?”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:32:47  4b2ff6554f "“Why, the wounded! It’s impossible, Mamma. It’s monstrous!... No, Mamma"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:33:40  474e4dc143 "darling, it’s not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:34:25  ac2f347c4b "does it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:35:23  2a71e2f6fb "yard... Mamma!... It’s impossible!”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:36:54  bff0406f1b "The count stood by the window and listened without turning round."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:37:32  170a912195 "Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:38:59  009e49b225 "The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:39:36  03924abdb1 "mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:41:57  d76fe1dc8a "to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:42:46  fa58d1ab1b "“Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?” she said, not surrendering"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:45:00  a929a823e1 "at once."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:45:54  5aef5ed799 "“Mamma, darling, forgive me!”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:48:16  28650fdebc "But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:50:14  62c3dd3e03 "“My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don’t understand about"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:52:33  047cb4abb4 "it,” said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:53:33  e048460008 "“The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,” muttered the count through"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:54:25  cff079a592 "tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:55:28  3154311461 "shame on his breast."
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:56:25  0496ec6a47 "“Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...” asked Natásha. “We will still"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:58:04  cb88900b58 "take all the most necessary things.”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 18:59:29  3e0816b2ce "The count nodded affirmatively, and Natásha, at the rapid pace at which"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:00:21  8f36514b0f "she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:01:54  5668401626 "anteroom and downstairs into the yard."
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:02:34  42fa9ab7f6 "The servants gathered round Natásha, but could not believe the strange"

 10/22/1812 Thu 19:06:06  afe0dc2492 "confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:08:34  43de653845 "trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:10:48  32e036674f "set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:12:50  76cc828592 "strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:14:53  196309e1d0 "be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:17:20  f45815809e "to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:19:20  f31c50737e "away but that had seemed the only thing to do."
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:21:39  c0deace001 "The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:23:59  1a01724bb3 "eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:25:19  5be1c20ba3 "wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:25:53  c0deace001 "happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:27:12  5a1658f3f7 "to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:29:38  c0deace001 "Rostóvs’ yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:30:41  8862f1dabd "but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:31:31  5e97bf42fc "unloading, once started, could not be arrested. It seemed not to matter"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:32:52  da3dab4c8a "whether all or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:35:15  4d9512132c "china, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:35:46  e26b6f0629 "packed the night before now lay about the yard, and still they went on"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:37:29  df60c0032e "searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:38:15  9ef2486996 "letting the wounded have another and yet another cart."
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:39:12  04ee827949 "“We can take four more men,” said the steward. “They can have my trap,"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:41:22  e968e3e4a5 "or else what is to become of them?”"
 10/22/1812 Thu 19:43:17  c47ab144d4 "“Let them have my wardrobe cart,” said the countess. “Dunyásha can go"

 10/23/1812 Fri 22:43:01  590b6119e9 "short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat"

 10/23/1812 Fri 22:57:58  9cad03bf65 "his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and"
 10/23/1812 Fri 22:59:41  ac541bcd76 "submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work."

 10/23/1812 Fri 23:17:41  dfe2851c38 "face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At"
 10/23/1812 Fri 23:19:37  ff52f6524c "the count’s first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if"
 10/23/1812 Fri 23:20:57  b799a4543e "wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye. But Rostopchín did"
 10/23/1812 Fri 23:22:45  b15e16d793 "not look at him. A vein in the young man’s long thin neck swelled like a"
 10/23/1812 Fri 23:23:51  c0deace001 "cord and went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed."
 10/23/1812 Fri 23:26:01  20e25d09e8 "All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more"

 10/23/1812 Fri 23:29:15  22f482dfd3 "and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step."
 10/23/1812 Fri 23:30:58  783b9a21b5 "“He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to"

 10/23/1812 Fri 23:45:53  2cba860627 "uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing"

 10/25/1812 Sun 01:35:55  c0e7fec5bf "But Natásha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:37:24  b7c31b9b3b "and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:38:37  c0deace001 "this condition of stupor since the morning, when Sónya, to the surprise"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:40:10  7e88c103d2 "and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:41:41  c9906029cb "it necessary to tell Natásha of Prince Andrew’s wound and of his being"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:42:28  7c199b775f "with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:43:43  2841be3a42 "she was with Sónya. Sónya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:45:02  f566385d8c "as if trying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:46:16  aa51fb6295 "cousin."
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:46:54  159ff1ac95 "“Look, Natásha, how dreadfully it is burning!” said she."
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:48:55  3357fcf090 "“What’s burning?” asked Natásha. “Oh, yes, Moscow.”"

 10/25/1812 Sun 01:51:06  423f097973 "her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:51:50  65d5e313e2 "that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:53:00  cbc62d475c "attitude."
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:55:10  ab9f876449 "“But you didn’t see it!”"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:57:04  94f323f08d "“Yes, really I did,” Natásha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left"
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:58:04  986a550542 "in peace."
 10/25/1812 Sun 01:58:36  08816ca890 "Both the countess and Sónya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:00:29  f3dad790b9 "nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:02:54  e6ad5bb12d "Natásha."
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:04:01  2a660321ef "The count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:06:11  37d1daf0cd "up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:07:28  faeabc879c "was wont to do when Natásha was ill, then touched her forehead with her"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:09:06  fcb76d8044 "lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her."
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:10:22  90336c53d8 "“You are cold. You are trembling all over. You’d better lie down,” said"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:11:48  cd763b7f50 "the countess."
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:13:07  39d404386b "“Lie down? All right, I will. I’ll lie down at once,” said Natásha."

 10/25/1812 Sun 02:16:38  c0deace001 "wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:17:34  58d3d4c646 "questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:19:43  eda68e89eb "could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:21:39  c874c480ab "him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:23:31  010e74375c "she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:24:34  ca48a907d1 "what they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:26:47  3f27872038 "still be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:27:24  83c51bc92d "of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:29:16  f4acf91103 "countess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:30:13  b81dd324df "way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving. She was"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:30:58  d30797777c "planning something and either deciding or had already decided something"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:32:22  0000587037 "in her mind. The countess knew this, but what it might be she did not"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:34:01  411824e981 "know, and this alarmed and tormented her."
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:35:07  5e3ae38a40 "“Natásha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.”"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:36:37  7e0276110f "A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:38:48  1b18d2724a "and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor."
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:39:27  178d396cb3 "“No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,” Natásha replied"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:40:21  e3fd3e8ca1 "irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:40:55  39bff794dc "window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:41:28  9f07dbef00 "her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:43:38  c38e2a0e94 "shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame. Natásha knew"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:46:07  ed40e81d67 "it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:47:17  7ca4f81d47 "the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage;"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:48:59  c0a6b580a6 "but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:50:07  174862e16c "a look with Sónya."
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:52:18  6a1d27967c "“Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet,” said the countess, softly"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:54:46  faf4db521f "touching Natásha’s shoulders. “Come, lie down.”"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:56:50  ea99d634d8 "“Oh, yes... I’ll lie down at once,” said Natásha, and began hurriedly"
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:57:50  50c507f9bc "undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat."
 10/25/1812 Sun 02:59:38  d8f136c69b "When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:00:39  b9f566317b "down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:01:20  69e0c24596 "floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:03:26  c0deace001 "and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:05:33  ef14af2cc3 "unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved from side"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:07:01  1f23a99f08 "to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:08:14  849fafce32 "her. When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:09:56  265b8a0416 "sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:11:23  944330fa1b "“Natásha, you’d better lie in the middle,” said Sónya."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:11:59  31fa731fc0 "“I’ll stay here,” muttered Natásha. “Do lie down,” she added crossly,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:14:08  acfcf1f8fb "and buried her face in the pillow."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:15:51  27f920dc61 "The countess, Madame Schoss, and Sónya undressed hastily and lay down."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:17:13  ee29718253 "The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:18:23  48210fd7a5 "the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:20:34  a18874201c "Mytíshchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:22:48  bff97b9eb8 "of people shouting at a tavern Mamónov’s Cossacks had set up across the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:23:40  26278954e6 "street, and the adjutant’s unceasing moans could still be heard."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:25:52  a59ffb5458 "For a long time Natásha listened attentively to the sounds that reached"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:26:22  f854acac86 "her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:27:10  d401188963 "her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:29:26  ce61c1bf54 "her, then Madame Schoss’ familiar whistling snore and Sónya’s gentle"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:31:36  58b40bb413 "breathing. Then the countess called to Natásha. Natásha did not answer."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:32:15  1eed8f81c5 "“I think she’s asleep, Mamma,” said Sónya softly."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:33:03  1c804c41e9 "After a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:34:18  24204df8ff "replied."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:35:35  81e542e0b7 "Soon after that Natásha heard her mother’s even breathing. Natásha did"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:38:04  2328f04033 "not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:39:09  6394a90350 "was growing cold on the bare floor."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:39:53  d42f37192c "As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:40:45  66d5080d78 "crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:43:08  ea9529801b "by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:44:23  a961488909 "adjutant was heard. Natásha sat up."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:45:26  ba1b278e51 "“Sónya, are you asleep? Mamma?” she whispered."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:47:18  40ccae98e2 "No one replied. Natásha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:48:43  3ad7d66b05 "stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:49:24  235d673a86 "bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:50:14  c0deace001 "foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:52:07  630e017ea9 "grasped the cold door handle."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:53:47  0ebbd76e52 "It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:55:54  8a790769dd "all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:57:19  3138356451 "terror and overflowing with love."
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:58:12  2b2a0deb8e "She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 03:59:03  c0deace001 "damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:01:29  6eaab21f85 "her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:02:04  7de4797d64 "the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:04:23  cd303c27e7 "in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:06:32  45e9612fca "something was lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:07:07  9e394d7214 "smoldering wick."
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:09:36  28f182c56f "From the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew’s wound"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:11:23  040bdde3eb "and his presence there, Natásha had resolved to see him. She did not"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:13:31  ecff3b4931 "know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:14:09  348283c078 "more convinced that it was necessary."
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:16:14  69704d9faf "All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:17:07  e6ddf4a234 "that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:18:33  3c68b23edf "see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:20:38  1d1fe0fcea "moaning of the adjutant’s? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:21:58  da502dabbb "imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:23:30  a36f04efd9 "indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:25:57  e139c5c4df "quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:27:03  84589eca93 "still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:29:20  c4fc146cd7 "cautiously took one step and then another, and found herself in the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:30:20  ad9107c07f "middle of a small room containing baggage. Another man—Timókhin—was"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:32:48  bc17f502f7 "lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two others—the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:33:52  525936de51 "doctor and a valet—lay on the floor."
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:34:55  c60a138d48 "The valet sat up and whispered something. Timókhin, kept awake by the"

 10/25/1812 Sun 04:36:10  f9b63e3173 "apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap."
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:38:29  5122b75180 "The valet’s sleepy, frightened exclamation, “What do you want? What’s"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:40:19  1ea92f4bd0 "the matter?” made Natásha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:42:23  81fb563888 "corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him."
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:43:29  a9151c5b95 "She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw"

 10/25/1812 Sun 04:48:32  b4ba031769 "He was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:50:34  6a3b64a4a4 "glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:51:04  f3194a9bc4 "delicate as a child’s, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:53:19  c94ca77ee6 "gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had never"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:54:52  b21067017f "seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible,"
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:57:20  516d39cb60 "youthful movement dropped on her knees."
 10/25/1812 Sun 04:59:34  3ebd3174d5 "He smiled and held out his hand to her."

 10/25/1812 Sun 12:04:16  2f3eb1d0ad "even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose"
 10/25/1812 Sun 12:06:10  8ed278f13b "from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets"

 10/25/1812 Sun 12:31:46  757796da2b "and sniffing at her singed hair. The woman’s husband, a short,"

 10/25/1812 Sun 13:19:44  9312093668 "sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt"
