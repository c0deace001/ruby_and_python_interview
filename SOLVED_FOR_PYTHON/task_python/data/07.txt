 10/13/1812 Tue 08:45:36  99a33c620f "Hendríkhovna’s plump little hands with their short and not overclean"
 10/13/1812 Tue 08:47:10  a613f0038e "nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love with"
 10/13/1812 Tue 08:48:26  fd789c48ef "her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon"
 10/13/1812 Tue 08:50:33  29b724d0ad "left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general"
 10/13/1812 Tue 08:51:06  1e222c4ac8 "mood of courting Mary Hendríkhovna. She, seeing herself surrounded by"

 10/13/1812 Tue 08:59:44  07761e2536 "Hendríkhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rostóv received"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:01:01  117c233844 "his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary Hendríkhovna to stir"

 10/13/1812 Tue 09:04:24  018cfb3daa "“But you take it without sugar?” she said, smiling all the time, as if"

 10/13/1812 Tue 09:26:01  c757df51c9 "proposed that they should play “Kings” with Mary Hendríkhovna. They drew"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:28:06  8eb39ad60e "lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rostóv’s suggestion it"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:29:10  348d24a301 "was agreed that whoever became “King” should have the right to kiss Mary"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:31:07  f1d653b2b6 "Hendríkhovna’s hand, and that the “Booby” should go to refill and reheat"

 10/13/1812 Tue 09:36:55  5cb1145f47 "suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendríkhovna. He had been awake for"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:38:00  b2abad4b2b "some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found nothing"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:39:25  3fa95026bc "entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:40:49  dcf0df6692 "depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:42:32  0a8537db2f "to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:44:36  dc1801a278 "had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:46:32  c372ae0871 "Hendríkhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:47:10  8b7e563701 "still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:48:57  f1c1dc868a "told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in"
 10/13/1812 Tue 09:51:20  c0deace001 "alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go"

 10/13/1812 Tue 10:00:45  e7c799df45 "waiting for the game to end."
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:02:44  26e27df077 "Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:05:05  150cec8928 "still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:06:35  26e00ac09f "which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:07:19  3c06d3055f "his wife with him, and had settled down with her in their covered cart,"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:08:17  f82fffc2f5 "the officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:10:02  3251ef5277 "wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:12:13  6921953883 "remarks, recalling the doctor’s uneasiness and his wife’s delight, now"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:13:38  41fae9f279 "they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:14:43  2e46fa290f "covered trap. Several times Rostóv, covering his head, tried to go"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:17:08  4a65687479 "to sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:18:44  1594836600 "resumed, to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter."

 10/13/1812 Tue 10:25:50  80585c369e "getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:27:58  f40dda0a1e "Rostóv went off to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:29:05  52523bb636 "breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:29:58  f9984fae5c "damp and cold, especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left"

 10/13/1812 Tue 10:35:09  5533f945d0 "under the apron of which his feet were sticking out, and in the middle"

 10/13/1812 Tue 10:44:31  39dc3036b3 "Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:45:58  94cc0df610 "was heard to “mount” and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted."
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:48:24  c64bdb478f "Rostóv riding in front gave the order “Forward!” and the hussars, with"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:49:04  9217baa7f2 "clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses’ hoofs splashing in the"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:50:38  aad86eb93f "mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:51:25  1afbcca762 "trees on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone"

 10/13/1812 Tue 10:54:19  c3b5c31560 "Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:56:01  dda86f3286 "before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:58:23  dcc23c4f62 "which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still"
 10/13/1812 Tue 10:59:25  1ab6ba162b "wet with the night’s rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:00:13  660f73dc40 "wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:02:33  442ba1cb26 "side. The soldiers’ faces were more and more clearly visible. Rostóv,"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:03:51  71ee7999fc "always closely followed by Ilyín, rode along the side of the road"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:04:42  9bf2d35b38 "between two rows of birch trees."
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:05:27  3348e43578 "When campaigning, Rostóv allowed himself the indulgence of riding not"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:07:39  19c50232a3 "a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman,"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:09:19  a56c188898 "he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Donéts horse,"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:11:34  b761005b07 "dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:12:15  d4e46c2b15 "outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:14:10  6a0e1f135a "of the horse, of the morning, of the doctor’s wife, but not once of the"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:16:12  816004770d "impending danger."
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:18:40  2a31397bc4 "Formerly, when going into action, Rostóv had felt afraid; now he had"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:20:44  62595dc7cd "not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:21:46  8fc83085ad "used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:22:50  cc5fefd8d3 "he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:23:36  3aad3b5864 "accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:24:53  07f3df91ec "seem most likely to interest him—the impending danger. During the"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:26:53  de882c4be6 "first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:28:59  491eca9b0e "himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:30:21  c0deace001 "it had come of itself. Now he rode beside Ilyín under the birch trees,"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:31:17  77eb6fe1dd "occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:32:36  7a00c92fea "touching his horse’s side with his foot, or, without turning round,"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:33:40  3b7d8b7ae1 "handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him, with as"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:35:40  f60cd3e091 "calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride. He"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:37:16  4046bb9d66 "glanced with pity at the excited face of Ilyín, who talked much and in"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:39:37  65ab269d55 "great agitation. He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:40:14  31209f5362 "terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:41:02  303bc2f993 "help him."
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:43:16  8b9f04ef16 "As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds,"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:44:18  4cafa4d443 "the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:45:16  6678d06764 "after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:47:12  c0deace001 "all was still. The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:48:24  9e75c5829c "behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:50:27  fce3661d22 "reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:51:59  1bf72132a7 "edge. Everything grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:54:21  2d2ebdea77 "if in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them."
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:56:09  efca688aa1 "Before Rostóv had had time to consider and determine the distance of"
 10/13/1812 Tue 11:57:53  3e2cd651bb "that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstóy’s adjutant came galloping from"

 10/13/1812 Tue 12:02:28  f0b826435b "also quickened their pace—rode down a hill, and passing through an empty"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:03:42  79906b6a8a "and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to lather and the"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:05:27  ee789c0358 "men to flush."
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:07:35  d5c47a80f5 "“Halt! Dress your ranks!” the order of the regimental commander was"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:08:57  f680c58235 "heard ahead. “Forward by the left. Walk, march!” came the order from in"

 10/13/1812 Tue 12:11:00  b6588eb923 "And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:11:58  dbd73eaf0b "our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:13:23  f8caa8b468 "the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve."
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:15:25  8c73d836a4 "Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:16:49  926482b6a5 "the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:18:55  f0be049c9b "sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemy’s"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:19:31  df8454aea6 "columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:20:17  c0deace001 "briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale."
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:22:44  276c269788 "At these sounds, long unheard, Rostóv’s spirits rose, as at the strains"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:23:30  c0deace001 "of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together,"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:25:33  6c95169543 "now several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:26:51  6fc0b7808b "again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding"

 10/13/1812 Tue 12:30:11  1105c4a235 "The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:30:41  89fab2559c "began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron,"
 10/13/1812 Tue 12:31:14  5ab2143466 "halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to"

 10/15/1812 Thu 12:16:09  c0deace001 "It was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the"

 10/15/1812 Thu 12:18:49  9826f5bbb4 "and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling"
 10/15/1812 Thu 12:19:53  3a4e1810dd "and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull"

 10/15/1812 Thu 12:23:02  07f742ebb9 "cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds"
 10/15/1812 Thu 12:23:52  8c5fcbebd1 "were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the"
 10/15/1812 Thu 12:25:31  c54766167c "town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was"
 10/15/1812 Thu 12:26:14  5ea9b27471 "being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered"
 10/15/1812 Thu 12:28:16  b301ef8218 "up after four o’clock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of"

 10/15/1812 Thu 13:32:15  dad04bcb91 "rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The mistress"
 10/15/1812 Thu 13:33:34  3c70127fc1 "rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked"

 10/15/1812 Thu 13:37:37  fc3b4d2024 "in the street. A shopman who entered told her that her husband had"

 10/15/1812 Thu 13:58:12  b74ef1ae34 "ran into Ferapóntov’s yard before Alpátych’s eyes. Alpátych went out"

 10/15/1812 Thu 14:09:47  4d996e12a6 "and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly"
 10/15/1812 Thu 14:11:14  d4307c90fd "began to wail as they looked at the fires—the smoke and even the flames"

 10/15/1812 Thu 14:14:41  4b79e95be9 "same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street."
 10/15/1812 Thu 14:15:58  658f39b676 "Inside the shed Alpátych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and"

 10/15/1812 Thu 14:22:25  748f20d254 "knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapóntov returned"
 10/15/1812 Thu 14:23:33  d93591d3bd "and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at"

 10/15/1812 Thu 14:26:10  4d21dd8791 "and laughter:"
 10/15/1812 Thu 14:28:09  c0deace001 "“Loot everything, lads! Don’t let those devils get it!” he cried, taking"

 10/15/1812 Thu 14:53:00  5d0f363e74 "the flames talking and shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap"
 10/15/1812 Thu 14:53:32  37170dfddd "would not be able to move on for some time, Alpátych got down and turned"
 10/15/1812 Thu 14:54:13  3ffc9d78b5 "into the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers were continually"
 10/15/1812 Thu 14:56:17  81ad9e2530 "rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he saw two of them and a"

 10/15/1812 Thu 15:01:53  5c209b7c74 "blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen"

 10/15/1812 Thu 15:06:11  10225a3f5f "crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and Alpátych"
 10/15/1812 Thu 15:08:15  e4305eb68c "watched for it too."
 10/15/1812 Thu 15:09:44  22001c1bef "“Alpátych!” a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man."
 10/15/1812 Thu 15:11:31  ee6934b7bf "“Mercy on us! Your excellency!” answered Alpátych, immediately"
 10/15/1812 Thu 15:13:36  6950112ab6 "recognizing the voice of his young prince."
 10/15/1812 Thu 15:14:35  683464b6e1 "Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking"

 10/15/1812 Thu 15:23:16  2280958d06 "worn face. Alpátych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it"
 10/15/1812 Thu 15:25:10  0e3901f5f4 "was to get away."
 10/15/1812 Thu 15:26:23  f285ffe2e3 "“Are we really quite lost, your excellency?” he asked again."

 10/15/1812 Thu 15:28:55  d56ee325e8 "began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:"

 10/16/1812 Fri 06:36:31  192c009402 "going on around him or not. One thing was certain—that he was suffering"

 10/16/1812 Fri 11:00:41  b0acddde82 "never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as"

 10/17/1812 Sat 00:37:33  95b4fe2f3d "to Tíkhon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:39:28  c0deace001 "standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful for him"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:40:25  c0deace001 "to talk to Tíkhon who did not understand him. I remember how he began"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:41:27  bbf4b968b3 "speaking to him about Lise as if she were alive—he had forgotten she"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:43:01  5b8713383b "was dead—and Tíkhon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted,"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:44:06  c0b1bcf8ff "‘Fool!’ He was greatly depressed. From behind the door I heard how he"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:45:27  59dae3a5f4 "lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed, ‘My God!’ Why didn’t"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:46:13  2d55538d27 "I go in then? What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:48:19  69d03a2ffe "perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:50:13  c9851828d0 "to me.” And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said"
 10/17/1812 Sat 00:52:11  5e684ee756 "to her on the day of his death. “Dear-est!” she repeated, and began"
