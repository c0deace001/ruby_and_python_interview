 09/27/1812 Sun 00:57:27  21f2f48db1 "and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag"

 09/27/1812 Sun 00:59:02  a006f17294 "was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and,"

 09/27/1812 Sun 01:02:35  0cb3857708 "their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry"

 09/27/1812 Sun 01:11:12  bb1785f7a3 "he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front"

 09/27/1812 Sun 01:35:09  245d907b42 "seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head"
 09/27/1812 Sun 01:36:24  0efcef247f "with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of"

 09/27/1812 Sun 01:54:02  cf3d01367a "and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds"

 09/27/1812 Sun 04:33:24  4a90ae028a "he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that"
 09/27/1812 Sun 04:34:16  0014f60cca "amazed the French themselves. Rostóv was horrified to hear later that"

 09/27/1812 Sun 04:44:04  1a76af1fd8 "much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on"

 09/27/1812 Sun 05:01:34  5e8185c9d4 "“Can you imagine it?” and he began describing how the Guards, having"

 09/27/1812 Sun 05:05:17  46e336f527 "Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged"

 09/27/1812 Sun 05:33:49  076f6dc4d1 "Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostóv, to avoid"
 09/27/1812 Sun 05:34:57  625b3b2fd3 "again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse"
 09/27/1812 Sun 05:36:22  7ecd181369 "Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place"
 09/27/1812 Sun 05:36:58  406da14b49 "where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he"
 09/27/1812 Sun 05:38:47  8ed3bdf348 "heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops,"

 09/27/1812 Sun 05:42:45  1b58508be1 "“What can it be?” he thought. “The enemy in the rear of our army?"
 09/27/1812 Sun 05:43:16  e4d5d2c45d "Impossible!” And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself"

 09/27/1812 Sun 06:56:04  71269b210d "question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a"

 09/27/1812 Sun 16:25:18  cb88ae7d4c "Denísov, Denísov! We’re almost there!”"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:25:49  e3843b1ef8 "Denísov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer."

 09/27/1812 Sun 16:30:55  b9044c76ae "“Yes, sir, and there’s a light in your father’s study.”"

 09/27/1812 Sun 16:33:03  c0deace001 "don’t forget to put out my new coat,” added Rostóv, fingering his"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:35:10  222328451e "new mustache. “Now then, get on,” he shouted to the driver. “Do"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:37:18  a34ea25c42 "wake up, Váska!” he went on, turning to Denísov, whose head"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:38:37  c0deace001 "was again nodding. “Come, get on! You shall have three rubles for"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:39:46  b584fd13d4 "vodka—get on!” Rostóv shouted, when the sleigh was only three"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:41:06  ebc3dfa332 "houses from his door. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:42:19  c0deace001 "all. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:44:18  06428bcedd "Rostóv saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:46:38  7ce50d8c98 "broken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:47:58  b5980edc3f "sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:49:33  5053ac8365 "stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it."
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:50:08  713e561912 "There was no one in the hall. “Oh God! Is everyone all right?”"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:51:43  189f35ac15 "he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:53:04  133b62ae7d "immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:53:42  f9c42d1f8c "the familiar staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:55:56  224d2676dd "angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely"
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:57:39  531e32eb17 "as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom."
 09/27/1812 Sun 16:59:26  246975c6e1 "Old Michael was asleep on the chest. Prokófy, the footman, who was"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:00:05  c0deace001 "so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:02:08  8b225053d2 "plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the opening"

 09/27/1812 Sun 17:06:28  7939f04614 "of delighted amazement."
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:07:43  8e58810e45 "“Gracious heavens! The young count!” he cried, recognizing his"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:08:18  2d8d53745e "young master. “Can it be? My treasure!” and Prokófy, trembling with"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:09:07  909f697d7a "excitement, rushed toward the drawing room door, probably in order to"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:09:59  a9f093c000 "announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:10:55  0e7592ce7b "young man’s shoulder."
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:12:32  6a7e499eb9 "“All well?” asked Rostóv, drawing away his arm."
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:13:05  98ec5f0f7e "“Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They’ve just finished supper. Let me have"

 09/27/1812 Sun 17:22:54  5d62789144 "forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:23:57  252108e42e "large dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:25:32  fa153fa363 "tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:26:57  c0deace001 "already seen the young master, and, before he had reached the drawing"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:29:23  16db13c205 "room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:29:54  04432417a8 "hugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the same"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:30:45  b6a13d2800 "kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more kissing,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:32:16  6c09d1c655 "more outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:33:38  7464a5615e "Papa, which Natásha, and which Pétya. Everyone shouted, talked, and"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:34:29  5b687f6520 "kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not there, he noticed"

 09/27/1812 Sun 17:52:38  873d0c79a2 "Pétya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, “And me too!”"

 09/27/1812 Sun 17:54:15  45ba4e96c8 "with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang away and"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:55:19  f25a30cd99 "pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly."
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:55:55  e6d6a53b50 "All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:56:55  4f034db554 "were lips seeking a kiss."
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:58:36  259a7f5593 "Sónya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 17:59:57  c61d30fa1d "looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:00:38  e1af9e26eb "longed. Sónya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:01:36  be5c3c056b "this moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not taking"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:02:23  7ce28aff49 "her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave her a"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:03:37  4a84f82ab7 "grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for someone. The old"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:05:40  b67edd5fcd "countess had not yet come. But now steps were heard at the door, steps"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:07:23  359be3ab3d "so rapid that they could hardly be his mother’s."
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:08:53  3fb331aa48 "Yet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made since"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:10:44  7d9596055b "he had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her. When they"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:12:20  c0deace001 "met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her face, but"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:13:13  ffdaf70ae0 "only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar’s jacket. Denísov,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:15:41  8286d5b4fa "who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped"

 09/27/1812 Sun 18:30:48  ce09efc0de "springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:33:08  c5d1609ba3 "escapade made everybody feel confused. Denísov blushed too, but smiled"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:35:22  53d9995ac4 "and, taking Natásha’s hand, kissed it."
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:36:07  fcc3f192fd "Denísov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rostóvs all"

 09/27/1812 Sun 18:41:00  da9d558937 "movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:42:02  e4747ef554 "eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:42:33  b9891e6bac "to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:43:46  6d6683814b "handkerchief, and pipe."
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:45:00  4fd885eb71 "Rostóv was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:45:59  a60c1287b4 "moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:47:30  35434f436c "insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more."
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:49:28  64ff8fbccb "Next morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:50:00  4b535325b7 "till ten o’clock."
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:50:36  48eaca4b74 "In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:51:26  16bbefd006 "satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:53:20  0775df1002 "cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The servants"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:55:02  5172dd5552 "were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their"
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:57:05  fbfba4285a "well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco."
 09/27/1812 Sun 18:59:14  5d123b0039 "“Hallo, Gwíska—my pipe!” came Vasíli Denísov’s husky voice."

 09/27/1812 Sun 19:08:27  53f9ef230e "A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:09:03  d155a40293 "girls’ voices came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:10:56  3fd14fed51 "crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:12:10  13411b07e5 "and merry faces. It was Natásha, Sónya, and Pétya, who had come to"

 09/27/1812 Sun 19:15:57  0bdfc61a12 "“Nicholas! Get up!” Natásha’s voice was again heard at the door."

 09/27/1812 Sun 19:21:10  4a7df5ada9 "with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:23:29  b25cf83e5d "forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:25:26  f6dde2ce3a "opened the bedroom door."
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:27:38  d39895ac10 "“Is this your saber?” he shouted."
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:29:50  dd643bf98c "The girls sprang aside. Denísov hid his hairy legs under the blanket,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:30:30  ee0a2dd76c "looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door, having let"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:31:26  c28cbb7f09 "Pétya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from behind it."
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:32:07  9854ed7692 "“Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!” said Natásha’s voice."
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:33:48  6723277323 "“Is this your saber?” asked Pétya. “Or is it yours?” he said,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:36:05  8122abc3ce "addressing the black-mustached Denísov with servile deference."
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:36:40  38a3f3272b "Rostóv hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing gown,"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:38:19  c0deace001 "and went out. Natásha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:40:10  c34dc42ddb "her foot into the other. Sónya, when he came in, was twirling round and"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:41:01  b634f4fca3 "was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down. They were"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:42:56  e116b0c1e9 "dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:44:18  cf0883af1d "bright. Sónya ran away, but Natásha, taking her brother’s arm, led"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:46:03  1517c1cacc "him into the sitting room, where they began talking. They hardly gave"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:46:58  1392646b14 "one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand"

 09/27/1812 Sun 19:51:11  acf78ef99a "laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:52:03  a1392cbf55 "they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:53:37  71245d3fc3 "to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter."
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:54:09  608c8c5d90 "“Oh, how nice, how splendid!” she said to everything."

 09/27/1812 Sun 19:57:13  021dd3a79c "home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his"
 09/27/1812 Sun 19:57:43  f45ddaf3f4 "soul and his face."

 09/28/1812 Mon 08:41:35  e8cd7b7ba0 "badly through his spectacles, but that his wife’s connection with"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:42:06  3c9886ddab "Dólokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:42:46  e17cc055bc "disbelieved both the princess’ hints and the letter, but he feared"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:43:33  eb52ec53fa "now to look at Dólokhov, who was sitting opposite him. Every time"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:44:35  a50f2cad22 "he chanced to meet Dólokhov’s handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:45:25  5811b3a23d "something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:46:51  70cf12e47d "away. Involuntarily recalling his wife’s past and her relations with"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:47:31  c94340dd2d "Dólokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:48:10  e584e409b1 "true, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife."
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:49:52  bcce727aef "He involuntarily remembered how Dólokhov, who had fully recovered his"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:51:10  f658ee5d5b "former position after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:53:07  8e31b8c8c5 "to him. Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:54:01  336337189b "companion, Dólokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:55:06  cb21e82cc1 "him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how Hélène had smilingly"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:55:50  c0deace001 "expressed disapproval of Dólokhov’s living at their house, and how"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:56:46  5e04b852f1 "cynically Dólokhov had praised his wife’s beauty to him and from that"
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:58:23  8b8d44b436 "time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day."
 09/28/1812 Mon 08:59:01  769c05aac5 "“Yes, he is very handsome,” thought Pierre, “and I know him. It"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:01:20  794312fd73 "would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:02:20  c865e81dd0 "me, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him,"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:03:47  2564fcc795 "and helped him. I know and understand what a spice that would add to the"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:05:29  aac4640e2e "pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true,"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:07:05  92dfc161f7 "but I do not believe it. I have no right to, and can’t, believe it.”"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:07:43  55258909dc "He remembered the expression Dólokhov’s face assumed in his moments"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:08:20  2f4e38ee5d "of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:09:45  6cf674331f "into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:11:45  09ce2f5d67 "reason, or shot a post-boy’s horse with a pistol. That expression"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:14:13  18b9c5cb6b "was often on Dólokhov’s face when looking at him. “Yes, he is a"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:15:45  97d7e2a3b7 "bully,” thought Pierre, “to kill a man means nothing to him. It must"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:17:50  8c45b1d86a "seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him."
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:20:02  9fe04ed542 "He must think that I, too, am afraid of him—and in fact I am afraid of"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:21:27  9f78c50bea "him,” he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:23:34  21c568f18d "rising in his soul. Dólokhov, Denísov, and Rostóv were now sitting"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:26:03  0fe4e3aa57 "opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rostóv was talking merrily to his"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:28:00  8d37f3fa7a "two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:30:19  a4e99e7caf "duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:31:37  931076c64f "Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:33:44  9273a0d5ba "noticeable one at the dinner. Rostóv looked inimically at Pierre,"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:36:04  dddc45f1bf "first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:36:34  8302249628 "husband of a beauty, and in a word—an old woman; and secondly because"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:37:30  0aff9331c8 "Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:39:18  5a4fe3b406 "Rostóv and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor’s"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:40:05  191c40ada5 "health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:41:28  eff99aa3a4 "glass."
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:43:30  c0deace001 "“What are you about?” shouted Rostóv, looking at him in an ecstasy"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:45:19  f3215bc54a "of exasperation. “Don’t you hear it’s His Majesty the Emperor’s"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:46:20  30cde096d8 "health?”"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:47:39  e3fe824d5c "Pierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:49:10  1e53f9a126 "all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rostóv."
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:50:42  ea77222ca6 "“Why, I didn’t recognize you!” he said. But Rostóv was otherwise"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:52:59  1200541942 "engaged; he was shouting “Hurrah!”"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:53:42  23bb849f75 "“Why don’t you renew the acquaintance?” said Dólokhov to Rostóv."
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:54:12  e6916dd9b2 "“Confound him, he’s a fool!” said Rostóv."
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:56:29  c614e5a64f "“One should make up to the husbands of pretty women,” said Denísov."
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:57:19  0eae823bb3 "Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking"
 09/28/1812 Mon 09:58:36  fa0ad82521 "about him. He reddened and turned away."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:00:16  30f8db0345 "“Well, now to the health of handsome women!” said Dólokhov, and"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:00:57  8b0c9d9cb1 "with a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:03:08  34a4618032 "his mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:04:23  40584c276e "“Here’s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin—and their"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:06:46  49574c6512 "lovers!” he added."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:07:53  adadcaad1c "Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:08:37  e654c2b603 "Dólokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:10:52  f81c47af73 "with Kutúzov’s cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:11:26  3ed3e7cdec "principal guests. He was just going to take it when Dólokhov, leaning"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:11:59  c0deace001 "across, snatched it from his hand and began reading it. Pierre looked"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:14:03  8a183c79d0 "at Dólokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and monstrous"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:16:19  d83548d97d "that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:17:14  4a1dcc567a "He leaned his whole massive body across the table."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:19:36  e50c9c5e46 "“How dare you take it?” he shouted."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:21:10  2ecc2bf00b "Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvítski and the"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:22:22  d39cbae194 "neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezúkhov."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:23:29  8cfc4c68f3 "“Don’t! Don’t! What are you about?” whispered their frightened"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:24:27  ad82efce27 "voices."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:26:13  013549f98b "Dólokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:28:32  48598f8559 "smile of his which seemed to say, “Ah! This is what I like!”"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:29:53  b277417b70 "“You shan’t have it!” he said distinctly."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:32:20  15cccc543f "Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:33:40  7f3d5ce2c5 "“You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!” he ejaculated, and,"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:35:55  4553f918e4 "pushing back his chair, he rose from the table."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:38:09  3535a69836 "At the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:39:34  257f2d05c3 "that the question of his wife’s guilt which had been tormenting him"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:41:49  fb54dc6187 "the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:43:43  0207181d1f "He hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite Denísov’s"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:45:20  4b0fb1c0fa "request that he would take no part in the matter, Rostóv agreed to be"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:46:23  2c639c6da8 "Dólokhov’s second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:47:27  c0deace001 "the duel with Nesvítski, Bezúkhov’s second. Pierre went home, but"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:48:11  10c0cd2c58 "Rostóv with Dólokhov and Denísov stayed on at the club till late,"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:49:52  ce9d11abfc "listening to the gypsies and other singers."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:51:34  4f4d17874e "“Well then, till tomorrow at Sokólniki,” said Dólokhov, as he took"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:52:47  8d952fbf63 "leave of Rostóv in the club porch."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:54:42  030004bd6a "“And do you feel quite calm?” Rostóv asked."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:56:09  1db5490589 "Dólokhov paused."
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:57:27  9e03e455f4 "“Well, you see, I’ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two"
 09/28/1812 Mon 10:59:17  6ba3dd23ad "words. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:01:17  f696a26412 "affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:02:01  e57814c5cc "killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:03:37  2a83764fe2 "intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:05:54  e29df0fc43 "then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostromá used to tell"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:06:30  46296cd247 "me. ‘Everyone fears a bear,’ he says, ‘but when you see one your"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:07:02  0ccadf0230 "fear’s all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!’"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:08:02  8afc32870d "And that’s how it is with me. À demain, mon cher.” *"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:09:07  4b4c7195a2 "    * Till tomorrow, my dear fellow."
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:09:59  3163a157cd "Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvítski drove to the"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:12:07  a2fe16a0e4 "Sokólniki forest and found Dólokhov, Denísov, and Rostóv already"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:13:01  7ce2edefb4 "there. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:14:45  89e371b096 "had no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow."
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:16:50  3eb9debbb9 "He had evidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:18:26  e82ed54663 "screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:19:55  878842bd25 "by two considerations: his wife’s guilt, of which after his sleepless"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:21:37  5d9d9768bc "night he had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:22:08  0f9ce8ada1 "Dólokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:23:15  dffeb17bc5 "nothing to him.... “I should perhaps have done the same thing in his"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:24:21  78066e10e3 "place,” thought Pierre. “It’s even certain that I should have done"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:25:52  2a77e41a90 "the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:27:32  a35d496839 "he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee. Can’t I go away from"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:29:04  be05a970c7 "here, run away, bury myself somewhere?” passed through his mind. But"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:29:53  9927720472 "just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:31:39  cade0ac903 "particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the respect of"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:32:14  f02f9614fd "the onlookers, “Will it be long? Are things ready?”"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:34:07  c0deace001 "When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers,"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:35:59  66feb6c861 "and the pistols loaded, Nesvítski went up to Pierre."
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:36:49  8e9f85ba55 "“I should not be doing my duty, Count,” he said in timid tones,"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:37:59  a1685a0898 "“and should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done"

 09/28/1812 Mon 11:42:39  e3cc5b2499 "sufficient ground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it...."
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:44:50  150f409e5c "You were not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous...”"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:46:50  d141d99903 "“Oh yes, it is horribly stupid,” said Pierre."
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:48:12  7327c69d93 "“Then allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:50:25  bbc799a2b8 "will accept them,” said Nesvítski (who like the others concerned in"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:52:47  19a837be59 "the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:54:36  9d68829de5 "the affair had come to an actual duel). “You know, Count, it is much"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:55:12  da98e7294c "more honorable to admit one’s mistake than to let matters become"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:57:12  6167358981 "irreparable. There was no insult on either side. Allow me to"
 09/28/1812 Mon 11:59:26  58f6d62a99 "convey....”"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:01:08  622237b507 "“No! What is there to talk about?” said Pierre. “It’s all the"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:02:35  21aedb00e7 "same.... Is everything ready?” he added. “Only tell me where to go"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:03:47  c0deace001 "and where to shoot,” he said with an unnaturally gentle smile."
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:04:26  63216b515a "He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:05:40  b8386afcaa "trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his hand—a fact that he"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:06:58  825c097619 "did not wish to confess."
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:08:05  1ef23ca5ba "“Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,” said he."
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:10:20  1246fd0aa0 "“No apologies, none whatever,” said Dólokhov to Denísov (who on"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:12:40  7171fcc4f1 "his side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:14:41  0d8b49e8f7 "the appointed place."
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:17:07  4163c174d4 "The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road,"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:18:36  a158cb6d46 "where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:20:42  95dcaa24e8 "covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:22:32  c0deace001 "last few days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:24:00  3fb7f56fe3 "edge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:26:02  f5ad771fae "the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:28:03  23a27fb2b8 "Nesvítski’s and Dólokhov’s sabers, which were stuck into the"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:30:06  e0436185b7 "ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and misty; at"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:31:43  99916283fe "forty paces’ distance nothing could be seen. For three minutes all had"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:32:30  50a7ade66a "been ready, but they still delayed and all were silent."

 09/28/1812 Mon 12:35:13  98337072ac "“Well begin!” said Dólokhov."
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:36:44  8a7bc5c87d "“All right,” said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling"
 09/28/1812 Mon 12:38:03  d9efff7282 "of dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly begun"

 09/28/1812 Mon 14:51:56  1f1c39d24f "her face, and then immediately he saw beside her Dólokhov’s handsome,"

 09/29/1812 Tue 05:53:35  e8eb888f14 "returned home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and"

 09/29/1812 Tue 06:22:14  c0deace001 "“Perhaps,” coldly and angrily replied Dólokhov, glancing at Sónya,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:23:00  9445eaca48 "and, scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:23:34  de3627446c "at the club dinner."
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:24:44  b8ed04f340 "“There is something up,” thought Nicholas, and he was further"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:27:00  cca11f2c47 "confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that Dólokhov left immediately"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:29:13  8f2db83fdc "after dinner. He called Natásha and asked her what was the matter."
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:29:45  489b15d8e1 "“And I was looking for you,” said Natásha running out to him. “I"

 09/29/1812 Tue 06:34:11  778bc1fba8 "Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sónya of late, something"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:35:01  515db35dba "seemed to give way within him at this news. Dólokhov was a suitable and"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:35:54  6e3fb0f11b "in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:38:21  33249b2f22 "the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:40:33  638098524a "question for her to refuse him. And therefore Nicholas’ first feeling"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:41:48  c0deace001 "on hearing the news was one of anger with Sónya.... He tried to say,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:42:47  ac019a4d77 "“That’s capital; of course she’ll forget her childish promises"

 09/29/1812 Tue 06:45:45  64850ebe93 "again."
 09/29/1812 Tue 06:48:05  eee7f8b754 "“And fancy! she refused him quite definitely!” adding, after a"

 09/29/1812 Tue 06:50:27  a19e5073f0 "“Yes, my Sónya could not have done otherwise!” thought Nicholas."

 09/29/1812 Tue 09:10:36  40dea045a8 "though shy, went on carefully executing her steps. Denísov did not"

 09/29/1812 Tue 09:13:49  557d4ac902 "indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not"
 09/29/1812 Tue 09:15:20  52c61ebd6a "because he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rostóv"

 09/29/1812 Tue 09:31:10  042e692279 "timidly to the corner where Denísov sat. She saw that everybody was"

 09/29/1812 Tue 09:45:16  b80f503b0a "he unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his"
 09/29/1812 Tue 09:46:45  91ba7c0903 "partner’s hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 09:48:47  e635fca853 "waiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was"
 09/29/1812 Tue 09:50:01  7c6699190e "Denísov’s short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow"
 09/29/1812 Tue 09:52:01  1fee32f3be "he felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways"

 09/29/1812 Tue 09:53:30  256b77ed92 "one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room"
 09/29/1812 Tue 09:54:54  4493582539 "taking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across"

 09/29/1812 Tue 09:58:34  5e56a333c1 "he stopped short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:00:56  6ad0f8dd15 "clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:02:16  f157b56308 "against his right, flew round again in a circle. Natásha guessed what"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:03:21  be6188d0f5 "he meant to do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:04:56  3ca9b29738 "knowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left, now"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:06:44  f1d3453b46 "with his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:07:36  c0deace001 "and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:08:56  0ae481f330 "he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:10:31  0b311f9765 "and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:12:44  815e75795e "steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:13:56  0c7cfe4b55 "chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Natásha"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:16:09  bbbdd91e28 "did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:17:59  550913d111 "smiling as if she did not recognize him."

 09/29/1812 Tue 10:23:15  819120bdc4 "a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:24:17  38a0d358a0 "good old days. Denísov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:25:25  9b3ffa285d "with his handkerchief, sat down by Natásha and did not leave her for"

 09/29/1812 Tue 10:41:57  c0deace001 "two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he"
 09/29/1812 Tue 10:44:15  096b94ede3 "was keeping the bank. Rostóv had not seen him since his proposal and"

 09/29/1812 Tue 11:13:45  461927d1db "Rostóv felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke with"

 09/29/1812 Tue 12:10:20  358780dfb5 "well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts,"

 09/29/1812 Tue 12:18:12  07afd2eb65 "the pack. Much depended on Rostóv’s winning or losing on that seven"
 09/29/1812 Tue 12:19:58  92f6d5fdf3 "of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son"

 09/29/1812 Tue 16:56:08  3f56234458 "room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade"
 09/29/1812 Tue 16:57:16  6115608b18 "Natásha to sing."
 09/29/1812 Tue 16:58:47  d10f7d4788 "“All wight! All wight!” shouted Denísov. “It’s no good making"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:00:34  98414ec136 "excuses now! It’s your turn to sing the ba’cawolla—I entweat"

 09/29/1812 Tue 17:03:23  2165ac26a3 "The countess glanced at her silent son."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:04:33  42dd41a54b "“What is the matter?” she asked."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:06:26  11623e9bcd "“Oh, nothing,” said he, as if weary of being continually asked the"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:07:58  2b7e26b35c "same question. “Will Papa be back soon?”"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:09:15  fbd3b3096a "“I expect so.”"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:09:58  49a8f1c4a3 "“Everything’s the same with them. They know nothing about it! Where"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:11:08  2fd7c31744 "am I to go?” thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing room"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:12:53  6276984553 "where the clavichord stood."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:14:26  7ba5d32dfa "Sónya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:16:40  7eb21f906c "Denísov’s favorite barcarolle. Natásha was preparing to sing."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:18:20  8701b33222 "Denísov was looking at her with enraptured eyes."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:19:20  b64de66178 "Nicholas began pacing up and down the room."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:20:34  a044f9a111 "“Why do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? There’s"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:21:47  9b26d4968d "nothing to be happy about!” thought he."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:22:44  f9f5d38a83 "Sónya struck the first chord of the prelude."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:24:10  9a3c5d5fe7 "“My God, I’m a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my brain"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:24:59  360232c295 "is the only thing left me—not singing!” his thoughts ran on. “Go"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:27:19  6cc50a2a83 "away? But where to? It’s one—let them sing!”"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:28:17  773a8b00b8 "He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Denísov and the"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:29:09  65b75bf096 "girls and avoiding their eyes."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:30:27  11a43dec03 "“Nikólenka, what is the matter?” Sónya’s eyes fixed on him"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:32:42  b57011d44e "seemed to ask. She noticed at once that something had happened to him."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:35:01  137933f518 "Nicholas turned away from her. Natásha too, with her quick instinct,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:36:35  a6dfeffa6d "had instantly noticed her brother’s condition. But, though she noticed"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:38:18  130dd59097 "it, she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:39:38  1bf2c3a451 "sorrow, sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:41:55  27990c3bf6 "as young people often do. “No, I am too happy now to spoil my"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:44:08  c0deace001 "enjoyment by sympathy with anyone’s sorrow,” she felt, and she said"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:45:34  d23d51c9ad "to herself: “No, I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:46:56  181eb06cfc "I am.”"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:47:57  f7c90cfb6d "“Now, Sónya!” she said, going to the very middle of the room, where"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:49:56  a624426eb0 "she considered the resonance was best."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:50:33  668856f4d2 "Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:52:28  db186393d8 "dancers do, Natásha, rising energetically from her heels to her toes,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:53:14  47e5049e1f "stepped to the middle of the room and stood still."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:54:04  67532c5323 "“Yes, that’s me!” she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with"
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:56:32  c0deace001 "which Denísov followed her."
 09/29/1812 Tue 17:58:18  87dec76991 "“And what is she so pleased about?” thought Nicholas, looking at his"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:00:22  c0e6cc1c18 "sister. “Why isn’t she dull and ashamed?”"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:01:34  1236c6955b "Natásha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:03:50  9afc6a3b3b "her eyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:04:38  0bd9958838 "surroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:06:25  f187041824 "produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:07:00  6dbb632e6a "leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:08:45  d052843f4d "you and make you weep."
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:10:44  89f6b6616f "Natásha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:13:09  45779948db "mainly because Denísov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:15:14  5757cbcd46 "as a child, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:17:35  bc517e0d59 "painstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:18:48  e24b2771b1 "well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: “It is not trained,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:20:38  8160b7db9d "but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained.” Only they generally"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:22:48  c770b0a60a "said this some time after she had finished singing. While that untrained"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:24:58  547992c9f3 "voice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:26:02  516490cff7 "sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:27:02  d3815cc6fb "it and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a virginal"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:28:51  84b30f7bbc "freshness, an unconsciousness of her own powers, and an as yet untrained"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:29:30  c82cb8bbbe "velvety softness, which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:30:13  f0dd7b6e16 "it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:30:58  7d45ec9eaa "it."
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:32:30  b3e849e323 "“What is this?” thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:33:37  c0deace001 "opened eyes. “What has happened to her? How she is singing today!”"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:35:16  aa741fca5a "And suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:35:48  d4a88052d3 "next note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:38:11  99a5814964 "three beats: “Oh mio crudele affetto.”... One, two, three... one,"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:40:03  d6e47e473e "two, three... One... “Oh mio crudele affetto.”... One, two, three..."
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:42:25  19c883c6ae "One. “Oh, this senseless life of ours!” thought Nicholas. “All"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:44:20  10fecb2b54 "this misery, and money, and Dólokhov, and anger, and honor—it’s all"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:45:28  7cbcbc21f1 "nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Natásha, now then, dearest!"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:47:24  c0deace001 "Now then, darling! How will she take that si? She’s taken it! Thank"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:48:10  2a10cdd4d0 "God!” And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si"

 09/29/1812 Tue 18:52:46  692715eaeb "Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was finest"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:54:08  76aedcf179 "in Rostóv’s soul! And this something was apart from everything else"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:55:15  d24a268af1 "in the world and above everything in the world. “What were losses, and"
 09/29/1812 Tue 18:55:53  ee68f3ee3a "Dólokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob"

 09/29/1812 Tue 19:02:04  abeec2023e "reality again presented itself. He got up without saying a word and went"
 09/29/1812 Tue 19:02:39  18d15d47b2 "downstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old count"
 09/29/1812 Tue 19:03:25  b0d9c49e12 "came in from his club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing him"

 09/29/1812 Tue 19:13:42  ca202382a3 "“Ah, it can’t be avoided!” thought Nicholas, for the first and"
 09/29/1812 Tue 19:15:13  c0deace001 "last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel"
 09/29/1812 Tue 19:17:15  cb48f9cc47 "ashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him"

 09/29/1812 Tue 19:24:08  5a8998e156 "“Very much,” said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless"

 09/29/1812 Tue 19:28:18  5ea19009da "“What! To whom?... Nonsense!” cried the count, suddenly reddening"

 09/29/1812 Tue 19:43:28  e3af37a03b "The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son’s words and began"

 09/29/1812 Tue 20:15:51  29d7d56e2c "“Don’t, Natásha! What nonsense!” she said, hoping it was a joke."
 09/29/1812 Tue 20:17:57  0277e4bffd "“Nonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact,” said Natásha"

 09/29/1812 Tue 22:50:16  8accc5a69d "ask himself. It was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his"
