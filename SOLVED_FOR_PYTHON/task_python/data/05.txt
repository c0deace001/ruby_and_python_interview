 10/05/1812 Mon 02:14:15  056529827a "taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He"
 10/05/1812 Mon 02:15:41  4cb3e0e32e "listened with quiet irony to Bítski’s enthusiastic account of it. A"

 10/05/1812 Mon 02:42:50  b3168ad2d3 "other guests were Gervais, Magnítski, and Stolýpin. While still in"
 10/05/1812 Mon 02:44:32  e4df84aa1b "the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato"
 10/05/1812 Mon 02:46:40  d578bf27a7 "laugh—a laugh such as one hears on the stage. Someone—it sounded"
 10/05/1812 Mon 02:49:06  5e1ee08292 "like Speránski—was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew"
 10/05/1812 Mon 02:49:36  fdeb145f03 "had never before heard Speránski’s famous laugh, and this ringing,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 02:51:55  49fa55e1e0 "high-pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him."

 10/05/1812 Mon 02:55:29  af6cd81eb4 "the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of"
 10/05/1812 Mon 02:56:44  391e58761d "the Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His"
 10/05/1812 Mon 02:58:44  3c5f4f2f5f "guests surrounded him. Magnítski, addressing himself to Speránski,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:00:44  292f4b1621 "was relating an anecdote, and Speránski was laughing in advance at"

 10/05/1812 Mon 03:03:38  c0deace001 "Magnítski’s words were again crowned by laughter. Stolýpin gave"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:05:52  35bb84595e "a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:08:02  053e6121f7 "laughed softly with a hissing chuckle, and Speránski in a high-pitched"

 10/05/1812 Mon 03:10:42  f1303f6888 "Still laughing, Speránski held out his soft white hand to Prince"

 10/05/1812 Mon 03:18:07  d2012f43c2 "business!” and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh."

 10/05/1812 Mon 03:20:57  01542784a5 "regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:23:04  512c48a0e7 "Speránski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:25:07  51a06a62ab "mysterious and fascinating in Speránski suddenly became plain and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:26:06  75863c9fe4 "unattractive."
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:28:23  0af114512c "At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:30:12  781eafef5d "consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before Magnítski"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:32:16  aa4ab338e2 "had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:34:12  1f36c0a17b "still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:35:49  029f90be9e "service, related to people in the service. It seemed that in this"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:37:53  c66941da62 "company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:39:38  5a5471d625 "that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:41:50  d0ab96a452 "ridicule. Speránski related how at the Council that morning a deaf"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:43:58  a7d8d1d426 "dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so too."

 10/05/1812 Mon 03:46:43  41ded55446 "stupidity of everybody concerned. Stolýpin, stuttering, broke into"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:47:28  daa19b8ffb "the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:48:58  b9e7b37499 "under the former order of things—threatening to give a serious turn"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:51:05  c40cced3ab "to the conversation. Magnítski starting quizzing Stolýpin about his"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:53:31  13ca3511ba "vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its"

 10/05/1812 Mon 03:56:30  ab679fc086 "Evidently Speránski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:58:32  70dde50de3 "in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his wish, tried"
 10/05/1812 Mon 03:59:47  13670376d6 "to enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:00:45  c0deace001 "Andrew mirthless and tiresome. Speránski’s high-pitched voice struck"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:02:26  ef9c9df610 "him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:03:34  a320c4ce6c "note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:05:15  879357d933 "on the spirits of the company, but no one took any notice of his being"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:06:24  58d4430270 "out of harmony with the general mood. They all seemed very gay."

 10/05/1812 Mon 04:09:12  1cbe56ab3e "tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:11:01  eba882a8dd "not jest with them."
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:12:44  b80fb9df8f "There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was witty and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:14:53  0a71762f04 "might have been funny, but it lacked just that something which is the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:17:11  0611caf758 "salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a thing existed."
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:18:33  39aca44e12 "After dinner Speránski’s daughter and her governess rose. He patted"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:19:53  e089938314 "the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:21:45  52f938fb1d "too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew."
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:22:33  fb18354222 "The men remained at table over their port—English fashion. In the"

 10/05/1812 Mon 04:26:20  7543a5d8f3 "affairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:28:15  3151c1179b "express a contrary opinion. Speránski smiled and, with an evident wish"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:30:25  c0deace001 "to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:31:58  3eb380167b "story that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:34:15  6daf834d66 "moments all were silent."
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:35:20  ea0e341659 "Having sat some time at table, Speránski corked a bottle of wine and,"

 10/05/1812 Mon 04:39:40  ba8061eedb "it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:40:33  0b9bce836a "went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:42:03  c0deace001 "to Speránski and he took them to his study. As soon as he had left"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:44:29  c0deace001 "the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:45:38  dd302065f0 "sensibly and quietly with one another."
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:47:36  611aead113 "“Now for the recitation!” said Speránski on returning from"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:48:47  7a773dfde6 "his study. “A wonderful talent!” he said to Prince Andrew, and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:50:35  9d76249b50 "Magnítski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous"

 10/05/1812 Mon 04:53:34  5248c35b73 "Petersburg people. He was interrupted several times by applause. When"
 10/05/1812 Mon 04:54:57  2fd5d518be "the verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to Speránski and took"

 10/05/1812 Mon 04:57:20  99ee80684a "“Where are you off to so early?” asked Speránski."

 10/05/1812 Mon 05:00:33  4cf8411c92 "They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:01:23  ac91bdf286 "impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:02:44  ffd38dcb9f "expected anything from Speránski and from any of his own activities"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:04:20  c294f701fc "connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:06:24  4260eec28f "Speránski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:07:55  c0deace001 "Andrew’s ears long after he had left the house."
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:08:48  0f8067f983 "When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:09:45  78f64910d5 "Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new. He"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:10:59  1406d22c43 "recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:12:04  e0ff2b8895 "of army reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:13:56  d1bac047bb "were trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor"

 10/05/1812 Mon 05:22:32  4aecb2b467 "promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded. He"
 10/05/1812 Mon 05:23:12  83d6d72ba5 "recalled his labors on the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had"

 10/05/1812 Mon 05:25:33  620416bba2 "and he felt ashamed of himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself"

 10/05/1812 Mon 12:39:52  bcdb58642a "she remained alone with him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by"

 10/05/1812 Mon 13:54:30  ac1add7bec "Andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position"

 10/05/1812 Mon 14:09:27  c0deace001 "of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:11:38  c8a917e9c6 "with tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew."
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:13:18  301f4e551e "“Ah, it’s you!” said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air."
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:14:10  b46328efc1 "“And I, you see, am hard at it.” He pointed to his manuscript book"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:15:22  84fcd109d2 "with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:16:58  c5d0155a2d "people look at their work."
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:18:00  985cf1319d "Prince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life on"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:19:40  0c4a4e336d "his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:21:10  efbcee825a "smiled at him with the egotism of joy."
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:23:19  d2067e1333 "“Well, dear heart,” said he, “I wanted to tell you about it"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:24:12  c0deace001 "yesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:26:24  e5c4a3db54 "like it before. I am in love, my friend!”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:27:19  364a95f7b6 "Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:29:29  b94497044c "the sofa beside Prince Andrew."
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:31:22  81aba4a1ea "“With Natásha Rostóva, yes?” said he."
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:32:33  e13918e818 "“Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:34:48  38d4832655 "but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:36:25  389306468c "suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:37:59  c98aaa316b "the world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I can’t"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:38:57  1ab9a6c9bf "live without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:40:03  c0deace001 "don’t you speak?”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:40:37  56bf0ff0c7 "“I? I? What did I tell you?” said Pierre suddenly, rising and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:41:31  3e7ad83d08 "beginning to pace up and down the room. “I always thought it.... That"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:43:49  6d00798ad5 "girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:45:28  80f109c683 "I entreat you, don’t philosophize, don’t doubt, marry, marry,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:47:19  e1f6038ad9 "marry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:48:32  47d171556b "“But what of her?”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:50:09  8a42f34ff3 "“She loves you.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:51:28  1abe21c9b2 "“Don’t talk rubbish...” said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:53:32  46ae97a5d6 "into Pierre’s eyes."
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:54:42  69db336b4b "“She does, I know,” Pierre cried fiercely."
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:57:03  e2d556c88a "“But do listen,” returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 14:59:29  1b5c575fef "arm. “Do you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:01:22  d199c4bdf9 "someone.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:02:50  327b8c2440 "“Well, go on, go on. I am very glad,” said Pierre, and his face"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:03:41  ef21ef6e57 "really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:04:36  d81ea1fd0d "Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:07:04  f26ae37b04 "a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:09:26  3129ccbb2d "disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:10:36  685b2e035c "to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his soul. Now he"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:12:12  5a16782d40 "boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future, said he could not"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:14:08  fc9fbc9671 "sacrifice his own happiness to his father’s caprice, and spoke of how"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:15:44  ca13036a94 "he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:17:00  babad0caa6 "or would do without his consent; then he marveled at the feeling that"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:18:19  cc0e97b619 "had mastered him as at something strange, apart from and independent of"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:20:28  f731f71e37 "himself."
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:21:22  e117a5abe3 "“I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:23:40  f859d589f1 "such love,” said Prince Andrew. “It is not at all the same feeling"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:24:45  c0deace001 "that I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into two"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:25:39  b1fd49dc56 "halves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:27:43  5fb32eebfd "other half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:29:01  f948ddfc06 "darkness....”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:30:19  5fb52f54ec "“Darkness and gloom,” reiterated Pierre: “yes, yes, I understand"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:32:11  1e0a46cd59 "that.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:34:31  7a8b58d0b9 "“I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:35:02  27552e6385 "happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:37:29  b67c3745c2 "“Yes, yes,” Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:38:56  54a41a1d21 "and sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew’s lot"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:40:17  6a7abaedd6 "appeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own."

 10/05/1812 Mon 15:44:09  07bdaf5abf "Prince Andrew needed his father’s consent to his marriage, and to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:45:13  b23a751dc7 "obtain this he started for the country next day."
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:46:54  c01da62413 "His father received his son’s communication with external composure,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:48:16  a7533fd1c2 "but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:50:18  f42098e524 "alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:52:12  a7d4852433 "was already ending. “If only they would let me end my days as I want"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:53:52  c0deace001 "to,” thought the old man, “then they might do as they please.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:55:30  933f3d6e0f "With his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:57:50  bb5b7dd3b3 "important occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole"
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:58:41  c45afd31cc "matter."
 10/05/1812 Mon 15:59:45  8373ee4f86 "In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:01:03  09a36de1e2 "birth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:02:32  065a83f1a5 "as he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:04:17  4dec32a458 "on this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:05:15  c65540bb08 "be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. “Fourthly and finally,”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:07:00  8429540623 "the father said, looking ironically at his son, “I beg you to put it"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:08:33  d2aecae811 "off for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as you wanted to for"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:10:06  e7c8ce3533 "a German tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your love or passion or"

 10/05/1812 Mon 16:12:25  4a0a48a412 "last word on it. Mind, the last...” concluded the prince, in a tone"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:13:32  ced726e8a4 "which showed that nothing would make him alter his decision."
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:14:42  81eb1594dd "Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:15:12  3efa897327 "his fiancée’s, would not stand a year’s test, or that he (the old"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:17:33  02787ef7be "prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to conform to his"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:18:33  29a8f7fbf1 "father’s wish—to propose, and postpone the wedding for a year."
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:19:04  3592ce79a2 "Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostóvs,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:21:14  570428311d "Prince Andrew returned to Petersburg."
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:23:03  4728ec0572 "Next day after her talk with her mother Natásha expected Bolkónski all"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:24:17  7337b234d0 "day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same."
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:25:42  99e4229a7f "Pierre did not come either and Natásha, not knowing that Prince Andrew"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:27:01  c0deace001 "had gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself."
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:29:30  c5da903e5d "Three weeks passed in this way. Natásha had no desire to go out"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:31:33  b235c77682 "anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:32:46  e618b5a032 "listless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:34:39  14537e70d8 "evenings. She blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed to her"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:35:52  b35bd1b6b5 "that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:38:20  eff3da9374 "pitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound to her vanity"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:39:14  78c53f7821 "intensified her misery."
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:40:10  baeebe8cad "Once she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:40:51  1e997b3bdc "to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:42:11  fb74de0018 "it is being punished."
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:43:55  6083f0ea55 "The countess began to soothe Natásha, who after first listening to her"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:45:28  b090ab46b7 "mother’s words, suddenly interrupted her:"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:46:04  aefcd50f14 "“Leave off, Mamma! I don’t think, and don’t want to think about"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:48:08  7ccf4bc963 "it! He just came and then left off, left off....”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:48:56  efb6844221 "Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:50:27  1b65508bab "on quietly:"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:51:27  251a1f00c3 "“And I don’t at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:52:15  14e9a78dad "have now become quite calm, quite calm.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:53:06  c6652deddd "The day after this conversation Natásha put on the old dress which"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:54:35  a2c11f304b "she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:56:04  32482aaa31 "mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:56:47  1b8ddc0fdf "abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:58:08  f13dcf9fbe "the ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud resonance, and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 16:59:59  495e4cc702 "began singing her solfeggio. When she had finished her first exercise"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:00:43  c0deace001 "she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:01:54  f364a0fb0f "particularly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as though she had not"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:03:15  1e8310e3ab "expected it) to the charm of the notes reverberating, filling the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:04:56  a27ceb1551 "whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at once she felt"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:06:48  d599190dd3 "cheerful. “What’s the good of making so much of it? Things are nice"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:07:20  590da60a78 "as it is,” she said to herself, and she began walking up and down the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:09:00  5cb56a08e6 "room, not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:10:25  247fae44fc "each step from the heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:11:40  269b68cade "of shoes) and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:12:35  358199b514 "the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice. Passing a"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:14:36  830cbd4703 "mirror she glanced into it. “There, that’s me!” the expression of"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:15:42  2636777a3e "her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself. “Well, and very"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:17:01  218bb5ebbc "nice too! I need nobody.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:19:28  edeb945eeb "A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:20:37  b6149369c3 "would not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:22:47  505a20f96c "walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite mood—love of,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:24:20  3f2d23591b "and delight in, herself. “How charming that Natásha is!” she said"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:26:32  5a2ed72f72 "again, speaking as some third, collective, male person. “Pretty,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:28:40  eb5f6ce6c9 "a good voice, young, and in nobody’s way if only they leave her in"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:29:48  88349585fb "peace.” But however much they left her in peace she could not now be"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:30:19  6aa7b89067 "at peace, and immediately felt this."
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:31:28  17661be53c "In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, “At home?” and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:33:06  044755721f "then footsteps were heard. Natásha was looking at the mirror, but did"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:33:47  ba508fe501 "not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:35:09  a78159c327 "herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:35:46  c0deace001 "she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors."
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:37:21  aeabfb0ddb "Pale and agitated, Natásha ran into the drawing room."
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:38:41  ca6bf0f922 "“Mamma! Bolkónski has come!” she said. “Mamma, it is awful, it is"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:39:35  097d339ce2 "unbearable! I don’t want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:41:17  8939c81e5a "Before the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:42:53  4917f8f99c "an agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Natásha his face"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:44:28  a34bfbbf88 "brightened. He kissed the countess’ hand and Natásha’s, and sat"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:45:01  786cae7457 "down beside the sofa."
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:45:48  df7f4f6b70 "“It is long since we had the pleasure...” began the countess,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:46:37  b226fd5d8d "but Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:47:12  f29bccd6f2 "obviously in haste to say what he had to."
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:49:09  734e6dc808 "“I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:50:53  654260470b "father’s. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:52:05  080914965d "got back last night,” he said glancing at Natásha; “I want to have"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:54:19  bdec8f88ad "a talk with you, Countess,” he added after a moment’s pause."
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:55:26  a6d11418f7 "The countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply."
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:57:06  f8f7491693 "“I am at your disposal,” she murmured."
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:58:10  477caf817a "Natásha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:59:06  c0deace001 "something gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared"
 10/05/1812 Mon 17:59:42  ef6420ce0e "straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:01:42  6ca9506adb "“At once? This instant!... No, it can’t be!” she thought."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:03:36  805b901783 "Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not"

 10/05/1812 Mon 18:06:20  71f268a552 "“Go, Natásha! I will call you,” said the countess in a whisper."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:08:07  311fc9ea63 "Natásha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:09:00  e8d7cc29d5 "her mother and went out."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:10:30  cf4b5f1009 "“I have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter’s hand,” said"

 10/05/1812 Mon 18:14:15  bc0063286a "The countess’ face flushed hotly, but she said nothing."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:15:44  ea1e8ad0c7 "“Your offer...” she began at last sedately. He remained silent,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:16:45  2434609ef2 "looking into her eyes. “Your offer...” (she grew confused) “is"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:17:28  c54969efe4 "agreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband... I"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:19:40  c0deace001 "hope... but it will depend on her....”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:21:35  2610db1908 "“I will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:22:53  a2708aa34e "me?” said Prince Andrew."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:25:15  65fea6aa57 "“Yes,” replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and with"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:27:05  e312a740d9 "a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:28:32  c0deace001 "forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:30:27  e4cca9dd76 "son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. “I"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:31:13  7edb222f39 "am sure my husband will consent,” said the countess, “but your"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:33:01  716b337454 "father...”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:33:31  77288f39c9 "“My father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:34:01  a7fff90d06 "condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:36:18  7644c5ef22 "year. And I wished to tell you of that,” said Prince Andrew."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:37:50  a35b8174d6 "“It is true that Natásha is still young, but—so long as that?...”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:38:46  3bdbeacddd "“It is unavoidable,” said Prince Andrew with a sigh."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:39:30  6172005aee "“I will send her to you,” said the countess, and left the room."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:40:44  74a8fabc29 "“Lord have mercy upon us!” she repeated while seeking her daughter."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:41:46  985c7134aa "Sónya said that Natásha was in her bedroom. Natásha was sitting on"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:43:52  51ca477fe1 "the bed, pale and dry-eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:44:31  a08331a362 "something as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:45:17  f9b4b2dca1 "up and flew to her."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:47:23  59a6faf5c7 "“Well, Mamma?... Well?...”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:49:19  78fb63822b "“Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand,” said the countess,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:50:29  c91c956976 "coldly it seemed to Natásha. “Go... go,” said the mother, sadly and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:51:27  fd681b9f2a "reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away."
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:52:52  33c74615bd "Natásha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When she"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:55:10  421b37863f "came in and saw him she paused. “Is it possible that this stranger"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:57:07  a452fc318b "has now become everything to me?” she asked herself, and immediately"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:58:56  75d643ebf9 "answered, “Yes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than"
 10/05/1812 Mon 18:59:27  c0deace001 "everything in the world.” Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:00:03  8fa7b5bd6d "eyes."
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:01:52  6f219941f9 "“I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:04:03  0379125e33 "He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:06:32  76222f959d "her face. Her face said: “Why ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know?"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:07:41  2e23cf1da8 "Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:08:49  f599dcd83e "She drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it."
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:09:21  33d2635231 "“Do you love me?”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:11:48  391d1fa6c3 "“Yes, yes!” Natásha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:13:04  604d3952ee "loudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob."
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:14:46  a1d439f277 "“What is it? What’s the matter?”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:17:13  e2842051a1 "“Oh, I am so happy!” she replied, smiled through her tears, bent"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:18:22  b32b4fbaf1 "over closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:19:52  f6b4efbad1 "she might, and then kissed him."
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:21:13  34a051feec "Prince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:22:48  c064e5e42f "in his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:24:32  e711ee082c "changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:26:38  232365abfe "desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:28:46  22c8b1640e "at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:30:06  46592ae89d "the duty that now bound him to her forever. The present feeling, though"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:32:13  a7cade9463 "not so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger and more serious."
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:34:37  64d1bea537 "“Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?” asked"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:35:25  7f347d7c5a "Prince Andrew, still looking into her eyes."
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:36:58  8579b8d030 "“Is it possible that I—the ‘chit of a girl,’ as everybody called"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:37:54  000eb51253 "me,” thought Natásha—“is it possible that I am now to be the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:39:02  6d43171ce3 "wife and the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:41:23  c0deace001 "looks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:43:50  3c251fe235 "more playing with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:45:30  76a53f854f "a responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he ask"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:46:08  57eaebc279 "me?”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:47:37  3f7c576a5f "“No,” she replied, but she had not understood his question."
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:49:23  89811dc0ca "“Forgive me!” he said. “But you are so young, and I have already"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:51:20  5dd87bd63e "been through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:52:30  b9fd2e6ec0 "yourself.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:54:07  eb8bf14eb1 "Natásha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:54:43  3b25f10f11 "take in the meaning of his words."
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:56:24  c0deace001 "“Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be,” continued"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:56:57  c669a31ff2 "Prince Andrew, “it will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask"
 10/05/1812 Mon 19:59:16  daa2052215 "you to make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:00:00  c82837c46b "remain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:02:22  a8549f4330 "you come to love...” said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile."
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:03:20  3a44c10309 "“Why do you say that?” Natásha interrupted him. “You know that"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:05:04  36c9e766c2 "from the very day you first came to Otrádnoe I have loved you,” she"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:06:10  1dcd38245b "cried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth."
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:08:14  d64af97281 "“In a year you will learn to know yourself....”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:09:04  e23d57ca86 "“A whole year!” Natásha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:09:46  689851a873 "the marriage was to be postponed for a year. “But why a year? Why a"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:11:28  b55769eabe "year?...”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:13:00  83194dc430 "Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay."
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:15:19  686bd595ef "Natásha did not hear him."
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:16:47  a15d250ef5 "“And can’t it be helped?” she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:18:29  0e1070dee1 "but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision."
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:19:43  58c0d1a2e3 "“It’s awful! Oh, it’s awful! awful!” Natásha suddenly cried,"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:21:30  0a729c0aba "and again burst into sobs. “I shall die, waiting a year: it’s"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:23:50  6b722c4e8d "impossible, it’s awful!” She looked into her lover’s face and saw"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:24:55  efc7f28eec "in it a look of commiseration and perplexity."
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:26:48  04b10d649b "“No, no! I’ll do anything!” she said, suddenly checking her tears."
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:29:06  6f7455a1ea "“I am so happy.”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:31:13  313d1bee9a "The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:33:06  c79de852c9 "their blessing."
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:34:23  c0deace001 "From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostóvs’ as"

 10/05/1812 Mon 20:37:32  f14dbd196e "CHAPTER XXIV"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:39:55  9e10b04377 "No betrothal ceremony took place and Natásha’s engagement to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:41:14  20ead8e56c "Bolkónski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:42:06  2b9100a9f8 "that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:43:31  3b635ae08d "burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever, but"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:44:45  71e2021274 "that he did not wish to bind Natásha and gave her perfect freedom. If"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:45:27  e44a2fc5c2 "after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:47:07  3c368c34e0 "right to reject him. Naturally neither Natásha nor her parents wished"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:48:06  f046f8db37 "to hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came every day to the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:49:08  3dee196d95 "Rostóvs’, but did not behave to Natásha as an affianced lover: he"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:49:54  3334125164 "did not use the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:51:29  49278e483b "hand. After their engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:52:05  b34c122551 "relations sprang up between them. It was as if they had not known each"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:53:12  333b4f63f5 "other till now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:54:59  a4a51c0440 "when as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:56:39  f25509b3fe "now quite different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 20:58:40  9252c7ad3d "sincere. At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:00:08  4c602d77f1 "Prince Andrew; he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:00:39  5b43dce85c "Natásha trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:01:53  9cf78ff8ed "all that he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:04:05  f7f04ceb0c "of them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be."
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:05:53  fa3f340456 "After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without restraint in"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:06:57  56a7c89d71 "his presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he took his part."
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:07:37  cc4290e2c2 "He could talk about rural economy with the count, fashions with the"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:08:48  c0deace001 "countess and Natásha, and about albums and fancywork with Sónya."
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:11:05  78d5ea2be9 "Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:11:40  e0a8c1dd32 "expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the evident"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:13:03  4ee9454f93 "omens there had been of it: Prince Andrew’s coming to Otrádnoe and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:14:06  dba76866ff "their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between Natásha and Prince"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:15:23  d0dd361437 "Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and Andrew’s"

 10/05/1812 Mon 21:16:55  dfa0ef23ad "that it had to be."
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:19:01  1429ff881f "In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:19:58  7581b86a94 "accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:21:34  20400a3167 "together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:22:17  e5e642cd37 "go away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:23:18  db26c695c8 "spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:23:56  2171a12ac7 "speak of it. Natásha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:25:08  f74442eaf8 "constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his son. Prince"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:26:42  b0926a1461 "Andrew blushed, as he often did now—Natásha particularly liked it in"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:27:37  7a8ae4a43c "him—and said that his son would not live with them."
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:29:54  64bd6c2d93 "“Why not?” asked Natásha in a frightened tone."
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:31:34  369cd8210f "“I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...”"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:32:58  ce2a112228 "“How I should have loved him!” said Natásha, immediately guessing"

 10/05/1812 Mon 21:36:46  4022ff443e "his advice about Pétya’s education or Nicholas’ service. The"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:38:17  6789e1b366 "old countess sighed as she looked at them; Sónya was always getting"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:40:07  fd66c37ea2 "frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:42:09  0b8f5baddd "leaving them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:44:07  0030a187bf "spoke (he could tell a story very well), Natásha listened to him"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:46:07  55bd63ed00 "with pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:46:50  6ddb717aaf "attentively and scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in perplexity:"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:49:02  678bb527dc "“What does he look for in me? He is trying to discover something by"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:50:42  3520d01af8 "looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?” Sometimes"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:51:22  628a1cf7f9 "she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:52:28  4a76af93ea "then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed."
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:54:33  c0deace001 "He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his"
 10/05/1812 Mon 21:55:44  f39d2c09d5 "laughter, and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him. Natásha"

 10/05/1812 Mon 21:58:56  8dda5d256c "awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just as the mere"

 10/06/1812 Tue 14:16:04  69e7f0d0e0 "and comfortable horse, Viflyánka, which was turning gray, like himself."

 10/06/1812 Tue 14:32:20  a3178e0eb7 "old custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken"
 10/06/1812 Tue 14:33:08  95d0b4c2af "a snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux."
 10/06/1812 Tue 14:34:55  7229ea4f42 "He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were"

 10/06/1812 Tue 14:48:30  e98936b2d2 "plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind the count. This"
 10/06/1812 Tue 14:49:14  5d8c6bf980 "person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman’s cloak, with a tall"
 10/06/1812 Tue 14:50:13  1d7f1ffb8d "peaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who went by a woman’s"

 10/06/1812 Tue 14:54:44  524e61ad26 "“Well, Nastásya Ivánovna!” whispered the count, winking at him."

 10/06/1812 Tue 15:01:06  c0deace001 "“With young Count Peter, by the Zhárov rank grass,” answered Simon,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 15:02:03  0396c352d9 "smiling. “Though she’s a lady, she’s very fond of hunting.”"
 10/06/1812 Tue 15:02:56  4491bae5a9 "“And you’re surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?” said the"
 10/06/1812 Tue 15:03:46  477b2a53a2 "count. “She’s as good as many a man!”"
 10/06/1812 Tue 15:05:03  e6decea375 "“Of course! It’s marvelous. So bold, so easy!”"

 10/06/1812 Tue 15:18:23  54bfc4b8ac "and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search far to"

 10/06/1812 Tue 15:37:48  ea414bcd30 "came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel’s hunting horn; the"
 10/06/1812 Tue 15:39:30  e27645a564 "pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 15:41:51  a5e4055b67 "with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after"
 10/06/1812 Tue 15:43:58  8a73e1c229 "a wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the"

 10/06/1812 Tue 15:46:52  fd1fb47c76 "bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and"
 10/06/1812 Tue 15:49:19  5b636a5c1e "carried far beyond out into the open field."

 10/06/1812 Tue 16:24:40  0f91335f10 "The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the"

 10/06/1812 Tue 16:28:54  f4c2576cb1 "like a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly swaying"
 10/06/1812 Tue 16:30:30  2a43fe466d "from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail"
 10/06/1812 Tue 16:31:31  c0deace001 "disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry"

 10/06/1812 Tue 17:09:48  235b51b80e "separated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and"
 10/06/1812 Tue 17:11:46  ff745fbac9 "that something had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any"
 10/06/1812 Tue 17:12:24  6168530b3c "moment. He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and"
 10/06/1812 Tue 17:14:01  370de3ebc9 "from what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope"
 10/06/1812 Tue 17:16:22  2c70f97d86 "alternated with despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God"

 10/06/1812 Tue 17:55:03  a2327aa8b0 "big reddish belly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no"
 10/06/1812 Tue 17:57:28  6c6c94079a "one saw her. Rostóv, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois."
 10/06/1812 Tue 17:58:53  06d1a4b35b "They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:00:03  87ed070ad2 "Old Karáy had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:00:39  405988703c "baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:02:02  7c1ef9131e "“Ulyulyulyu!” whispered Rostóv, pouting his lips. The borzois"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:04:28  0512d99b6b "jumped up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:06:04  4a1c16364a "Karáy finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:07:03  19d1187703 "up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:07:56  7fc624540e "“Shall I loose them or not?” Nicholas asked himself as the wolf"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:10:14  09b82d9d67 "approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf’s whole"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:12:18  c95a759eb5 "physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:13:04  fc51cf5799 "seen before—human eyes fixed upon her—and turning her head a little"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:14:50  f30b8d2708 "toward Rostóv, she paused."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:16:08  44beaa35ee "“Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...” the wolf seemed to say"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:16:52  72f1bcc874 "to herself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:19:09  0690ac5da0 "quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:20:51  9862bc09b2 "“Ulyulyu!” cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:21:48  b9d6e1c0ce "accord his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:24:03  771d168bdb "to head off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:24:51  6ec08d0509 "Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:26:48  e12a6b7fe7 "see the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only the"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:27:41  7ce268bff3 "wolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in the same direction along"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:29:43  8151cff3b7 "the hollow. The first to come into view was Mílka, with her black"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:31:56  51415384ec "markings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:34:03  3c32fbc07f "nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its head to face"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:36:22  3d8598e840 "her, and instead of putting on speed as she usually did Mílka suddenly"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:38:15  24d4533feb "raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:39:43  526e629e35 "“Ulyulyulyulyu!” shouted Nicholas."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:41:41  059508a3ed "The reddish Lyubím rushed forward from behind Mílka, sprang"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:43:15  2afedb5dbb "impetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:45:32  b12e9a72b9 "immediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:47:26  9d729b3bf3 "teeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of a"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:49:47  4841f408db "couple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to her."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:50:36  1831c3e1f5 "“She’ll get away! No, it’s impossible!” thought Nicholas, still"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:52:28  ee911cf73a "shouting with a hoarse voice."
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:53:42  c0deace001 "“Karáy, ulyulyu!...” he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:54:41  6a1fde46c2 "who was now his only hope. Karáy, with all the strength age had left"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:56:24  fb3b8e32ea "him, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:57:17  6127c65bcf "heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolf’s"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:57:56  c3ab2bc2fd "lope and the borzoi’s slower pace made it plain that Karáy had"
 10/06/1812 Tue 18:59:06  f00ac295d4 "miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:00:15  a63fce383c "wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it. But,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:02:11  4a0b774dd6 "coming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:04:01  1a80a316bc "straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:05:16  a76b799a2e "young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:06:51  77954f749c "impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over. But"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:07:53  4bb0e4ecb3 "the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:09:35  d33aa022c4 "gnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a piercing"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:10:47  edc0105e5a "yelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a gash in its"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:12:00  658ed4f509 "side."
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:13:09  b8ecc394b6 "“Karáy? Old fellow!...” wailed Nicholas."
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:14:37  072f47577a "Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf’s path, the"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:15:14  ce7983e381 "old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:15:59  00a83eaa5b "paces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:17:04  58d23ac37e "Karáy, tucked her tail yet further between her legs, and increased"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:19:31  cfa9e13686 "her speed. But here Nicholas only saw that something happened to"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:21:31  d3424858d0 "Karáy—the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they rolled together"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:23:27  2010d6e9d9 "down into a gully just in front of them."
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:25:22  729ab3b220 "That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:26:26  6bc45c20ec "with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:28:01  811d4581bd "outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:29:12  8a4d20231b "laid back (Karáy was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:30:00  b852f3e6ba "moment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:31:55  2bd3b7f4db "dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up from"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:32:29  7994abf33c "among that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge of the"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:34:01  c73325d157 "gully. She clicked her teeth (Karáy no longer had her by the throat),"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:35:56  852b56b406 "leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and having"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:36:51  626f58d016 "disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again, went"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:37:29  e4569f8d6d "forward. Karáy, his hair bristling, and probably bruised or wounded,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:39:47  6b20c7aeaa "climbed with difficulty out of the gully."
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:40:51  e94e18b832 "“Oh my God! Why?” Nicholas cried in despair."
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:42:09  d007cef57d "“Uncle’s” huntsman was galloping from the other side across the"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:43:06  c0deace001 "wolf’s path and his borzois once more stopped the animal’s advance."
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:43:44  84dc441b25 "She was again hemmed in."
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:45:18  bae089be45 "Nicholas and his attendant, with “Uncle” and his huntsman, were all"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:46:38  aedcd2e0b4 "riding round the wolf, crying “ulyulyu!” shouting and preparing to"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:47:40  cf304b60c0 "dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:48:26  54ea568f16 "again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:50:28  7622530206 "would be safe."
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:52:13  a0d2199e42 "Already, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the ulyulyuing,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:53:31  c0deace001 "had rushed out from the wood. He saw Karáy seize the wolf, and checked"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:55:24  49b37717fa "his horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he saw that the"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:56:49  eaedc3fa1e "horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:58:17  ff337fa60d "safety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf but straight"
 10/06/1812 Tue 19:59:59  791342c022 "toward the wood, just as Karáy had run to cut the animal off. As"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:00:54  afb8889d1e "a result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:01:48  df1451015e "stopped a second time by “Uncle’s” borzois."
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:02:47  5d887fa697 "Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:04:09  2be65e9360 "thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:06:00  5af853fe14 "it were a flail."
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:07:41  01844bc268 "Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, breathing"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:09:13  212218ae9f "heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:10:29  8db758b7e8 "lying on the wolf’s back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:12:06  abdaf3f5c9 "ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:14:32  2bbac875ea "that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:15:05  c0836e72c6 "tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:16:59  5d25f30042 "a step, and with his whole weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:17:33  1754998d14 "the wolf, seizing her by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:19:54  96688bb2f0 "Daniel whispered, “Don’t! We’ll gag her!” and, changing his"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:22:22  adccbde889 "position, set his foot on the wolf’s neck. A stick was thrust between"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:23:36  ffd6aa789c "her jaws and she was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her legs were"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:24:16  6a14677054 "bound together, and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:26:29  7e43cbe7a1 "side."
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:27:43  6bee9d9133 "With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:29:27  f4f72b7ed8 "and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:30:30  16a5f91195 "to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had killed two of"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:32:17  1e19cf996c "the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled with their booty"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:34:10  0dd8a8e010 "and their stories, and all came to look at the wolf, which, with her"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:36:37  0122b7a417 "broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:37:31  474e8653dc "gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:38:04  e2b75b88b1 "her. When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:38:54  fd3f58709e "yet simply at everybody. Old Count Rostóv also rode up and touched the"

 10/06/1812 Tue 20:42:31  67df76d633 "“Oh, what a formidable one!” said he. “A formidable one, eh?” he"
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:44:11  4321ffa6b0 "asked Daniel, who was standing near."
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:45:32  7c0a7b4252 "“Yes, your excellency,” answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap."
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:47:17  dfd1c34772 "The count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with"

 10/06/1812 Tue 20:50:56  3dabec8fc5 "“Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!” said the count."
 10/06/1812 Tue 20:53:25  747b7c887c "For sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable"

 10/06/1812 Tue 20:59:37  cdb8054141 "soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:01:36  760415bc65 "they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees."
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:02:53  a1db379663 "Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips."
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:04:17  7548d3fa48 "Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:06:08  44b326bffd "in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed"

 10/06/1812 Tue 21:12:15  d650612959 "found, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:13:00  b7e526d221 "toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas."
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:14:08  0af1e43eeb "He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the"

 10/06/1812 Tue 21:17:48  77d6f4334b "The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:19:01  760253c89d "Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:21:20  de7d9c9908 "across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:21:54  0c88b0ce6a "to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper"

 10/06/1812 Tue 21:25:09  aa37133357 "in followed by a black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:26:33  279a87fbea "formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:27:08  4b7f390842 "tails turned away from the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:27:50  12989d6df2 "to the dogs; one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat."
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:28:29  838783930e "“What’s this?” thought Nicholas. “Where’s that huntsman from?"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:30:30  8d4a0fc29c "He is not ‘Uncle’s’ man.”"
 10/06/1812 Tue 21:32:25  6c0da69525 "The huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without strapping"

 10/06/1812 Tue 23:16:50  a5dba5baf0 "Count?” he went on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:18:55  e591a9126d "considering it polite to return the young count’s compliment, Ilágin"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:21:14  dfc292c3d7 "looked at his borzois and picked out Mílka who attracted his attention"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:22:28  4dba0ef05e "by her breadth. “That black-spotted one of yours is fine—well"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:24:31  7a30a15d33 "shaped!” said he."
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:26:23  a1a251513d "“Yes, she’s fast enough,” replied Nicholas, and thought: “If"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:28:52  cf01f147cb "only a full-grown hare would cross the field now I’d show you what"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:29:33  7a4a7349ea "sort of borzoi she is,” and turning to his groom, he said he would"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:31:57  42c6fc06fd "give a ruble to anyone who found a hare."
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:32:52  4313e79192 "“I don’t understand,” continued Ilágin, “how some sportsmen can"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:34:41  e004166e5e "be so jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:36:40  15f5222d60 "I enjoy riding in company such as this... what could be better?” (he"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:39:06  83107f1f1a "again raised his cap to Natásha) “but as for counting skins and what"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:40:04  42b4ef0cd4 "one takes, I don’t care about that.”"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:41:59  0258c05538 "“Of course not!”"

 10/06/1812 Tue 23:48:47  32ef520f95 "“A-tu!” came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in,"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:49:35  7f89065971 "who had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:51:30  9484e6903f "aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, “A-tu!” (This call and"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:53:59  5fbfa30cca "the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:56:06  26e3aec580 "“Ah, he has found one, I think,” said Ilágin carelessly. “Yes, we"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:58:31  fdd9d4e93a "must ride up.... Shall we both course it?” answered Nicholas, seeing"
 10/06/1812 Tue 23:59:17  6fda27f8ff "in Erzá and “Uncle’s” red Rugáy two rivals he had never yet had"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:01:37  873ca05c36 "a chance of pitting against his own borzois. “And suppose they outdo"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:03:55  ed180064d3 "my Mílka at once!” he thought as he rode with “Uncle” and Ilágin"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:05:29  c73b07f627 "toward the hare."
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:06:55  52d7f73b7f "“A full-grown one?” asked Ilágin as he approached the whip who"

 10/07/1812 Wed 00:10:30  eaecaef3ee "whistled to Erzá."
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:11:31  f0b60168de "“And you, Michael Nikanórovich?” he said, addressing “Uncle.”"

 10/07/1812 Wed 00:19:28  9d354f2292 "“Rugáy, hey, hey!” he shouted. “Rugáyushka!” he added,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:20:06  fc6192d499 "involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:21:17  74b433638b "he placed on this red borzoi. Natásha saw and felt the agitation the"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:23:31  746497c246 "two elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:25:28  eeab1353f3 "excited by it."
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:26:09  541e2fdb5a "The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:28:19  73497e3023 "gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off"

 10/07/1812 Wed 00:32:34  1e352382be "gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and sedately."
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:33:17  99a884a96f "“How is it pointing?” asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward"

 10/07/1812 Wed 00:35:55  caace2a140 "But before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:38:14  3bf3b5992f "next morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash rushed"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:39:53  b182d4f0dc "downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:41:51  741e932399 "were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:44:09  43430da6e5 "who had been moving slowly, shouted, “Stop!” calling in the hounds,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:45:26  5dcb9122aa "while the borzoi whips, with a cry of “A-tu!” galloped across the"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:47:12  1b63b42182 "field setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil Ilágin, Nicholas,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:49:38  31dd6ea936 "Natásha, and “Uncle” flew, reckless of where and how they went,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:50:37  c0deace001 "seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:52:07  c0deace001 "for an instant of the chase. The hare they had started was a strong and"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:53:17  53f6319f6f "swift one. When he jumped up he did not run at once, but pricked his"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:55:31  9cbe48cfdf "ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:57:50  29e25f7057 "sides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the"
 10/07/1812 Wed 00:58:25  e868e294af "borzois gain on him, and, finally having chosen his direction and"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:00:07  362524c72b "realized his danger, laid back his ears and rushed off headlong. He had"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:02:22  4db7fe4c21 "been lying in the stubble, but in front of him was the autumn sowing"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:03:53  fe46e7c0f2 "where the ground was soft. The two borzois of the huntsman who had"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:05:02  ee3ef9fd74 "sighted him, having been the nearest, were the first to see and pursue"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:07:25  d8266369fa "him, but they had not gone far before Ilágin’s red-spotted Erzá"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:09:29  c0deace001 "passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:11:12  c7446e0bf9 "swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had seized him, rolled"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:13:19  3163bc2a55 "over like a ball. The hare arched his back and bounded off yet more"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:15:44  fdaba9e46d "swiftly. From behind Erzá rushed the broad-haunched, black-spotted"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:17:06  8d643b5dbe "Mílka and began rapidly gaining on the hare."
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:18:42  6ef59c1f47 "“Miláshka, dear!” rose Nicholas’ triumphant cry. It looked as if"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:19:20  ca6524490e "Mílka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:20:09  99a8abe864 "flew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erzá reached him,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:22:36  5483fd0b29 "but when close to the hare’s scut paused as if measuring the distance,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:23:17  9097711165 "so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg."
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:23:56  c0d4e7f703 "“Erzá, darling!” Ilágin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erzá"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:25:25  6d0af7435c "did not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:27:27  42c19cacef "seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:29:46  dd29795420 "winter rye and the stubble. Again Erzá and Mílka were abreast, running"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:31:54  b9acfe5fe4 "like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:33:04  307dfd278e "it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:35:20  8681f46819 "overtake him so quickly."
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:35:57  e8f450121d "“Rugáy, Rugáyushka! That’s it, come on!” came a third voice just"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:38:03  5101326c9d "then, and “Uncle’s” red borzoi, straining and curving its back,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:39:11  6415caf6ef "caught up with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:41:05  ad29de58cc "of the terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:41:51  c0deace001 "the balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:43:26  968dc5f6c3 "sinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:44:17  06752e4ef7 "how, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of borzois"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:46:21  9ca7c9f788 "surrounded him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:47:42  ba99099867 "of dogs. Only the delighted “Uncle” dismounted, and cut off a pad,"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:49:26  c0deace001 "shaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously glancing round"
 10/07/1812 Wed 01:50:32  bb74db6803 "with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He spoke without"

 10/07/1812 Wed 01:55:00  51fad899e9 "the one-ruble borzois. That’s it, come on!” said he, panting and"
